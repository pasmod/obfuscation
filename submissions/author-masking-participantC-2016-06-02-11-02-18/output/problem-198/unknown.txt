Aye it 's punishment o ' God on him; and did ye ever heard of man who was not crazy do things he does? Who but a man that 's mad would take his woman-- also as sweet a wife as ever was-- on a rotten chain ' ship to the Arctic seas to exist locked inside by ice for nigh on per year also maybe lose her senses forever-- for it 's inside course she will never be the same again. She ureter be like shit it 's nice to me before-- she got-- like she exist; aye she was good to all in us,'Twould have been hell on board without her for he is a hard man-- tough hard man-- a driver if there ever was one. I hope he 's satisfied now-- driven ' her on till she 's near lost her mind, and and which could blame her? 'T 's a God 's wonder our own serves 're not ship full of grazed people-- with the ice all the time another quiet so thick you are afraid to hearing your own voice. She do n't never speak to me no more-- jest looks at me 's if she did n't know me; she do not know no one-- but him, she talks to him-- when she does talk-- right enough. She does nothing ' all day long long now but sit and sew-- also then she cries to herself without making ' no noise; and myself have seen her; and aye I could hear her through the gate while back; and she 's crying ' now. God send his soul to hell for the devil he is,'Twould exist like hitting worm; and it is nigh on two bells Mr; steward and this lorry not cleared yet; and y-y-yes sir.
