The Judas Mark`` Cthulhu ftaghn'' He state with a laughing swaying his tilted head to the right in a drunken manner.`` Cthulhu ftaghn.'' he broke out into laughing fit, yet then equally soon as it started it stopped like lightning bolt outside his window. graham was his location in work, and as patient his work was hard to complete, and not like he wanted to do it neither; rain stopped.`` I hear youuuuuuu.'' he chuckled.`` I hear you flapping those blasted wings in front in my window.'' he giggler then sobered up.`` Damn go. Hence, of CA not Have MY Brain!'' Undeniably, there came a drum in plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to the orderly with a plastic flashlight, aforementioned light shining into his padded room.`` Keep it down in there!'' the orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.`` Power outrage eh?'' He chuckled.`` Wonder whyyyy.'' he rolled his head back to his right towards his window, as his eyes recorded the sound in earthly wings twitching like insects contemplation flight; oh how he hated those goddamn things, far worse than those Shoggoths he faced a while back. At minus the Shoggoths ate you thus ending your torment; as but a Migo…He shuttered, he did not want to think about it.`` Nyarlahotep…You son of bitch.'' he said looking grumpy then broke out in hysterical then going back as if it never happened. If it were not for you…I 'd be…I would be…'' Where would he be; and in his mind he 's seen himself of diam laying on beach with Lucinda their two kiss playing of the sand as waves crashed soothingly onto the shore. But then his logic would kick that to the pavement, lucid was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it were not for that Deep One that be dragging her-kicking and screaming-to the bottom in the sea; and he would be away from his insane parents. Formerly, That insane town of munich; and even if Lucinda did not accompany him he would at least be free from here; but then he met him.`` Jesus…''`` Yes?'' came sweet velvety voice, voice one would hear from royalty.`` Not you.'' he snapped.`` But I am him.'' Besides, hand placed itself on his shoulder as entire figure appeared sitting beside him like they were best friends.`` No... You are fucking antichrist,''`` Is there really difference in that either?'' jesus asked smile grating his regal black lips.`` Both promise paradise. From there it 's on person 's notice on what that is.'' he chuckled.`` And do not tell me that you forgot your title Ivan…Or should I say'Judas '; as''`` Then WHY Place ME Here?'' ivan shouted.`` Hey!'' the orderly shouted banging his flashlight on the bars again. What did I just say?'' the orderly 's face began to bubble; and his flesh boiled broken screams erupted from his face; yet he collapsed also scratched at his face letting more and more blood poor onto floor.`` I hate interruption.'' jesus said.`` also as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all potent than he claimed why did he allow Judas to remain in the fold; why did he allow lowly wretches hope; why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry laws before she could drown?'' He smiled evil as he described Lucinda 's gruesome devise, yet ivan panted heavily his rage rising more quickly than R'lyeh ever would to surface, ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity whom was already standing laughing at the mortal. Because there 's more to it Judas.'' jesus said.`` Judas of former be an major actor in the world; the wretches were a growing populace if they loved him they would worship him; as''`` Bullshit!'' he spat.`` Is it; yet''`` We want you to betray us Judas.'' Jesus said following his question was ignored.`` Why;''`` Sorry but us christ keep certain secrets from their disciples; as''`` What makes you Jesus; and''`` Our roles.'' he stated simply.`` You see…He was supposed to preach about us, and but unfortunately his mind could not take it, and so Cthulhu became a god. Not like it matters religion changes all time.'' Thus, he smiled all knowing.`` also no he was n't son of Cthulhu, and that was my little trick; and''`` Pray Judas'' He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black decaying lips mere inches from his ear. He likes that, it makes him feel powerful;''`` No'' Ivan said.`` I shall not a damned bastard, as also I wo not bring about their reawakening; and these cries will remain seated!'' jesus laughed.`` That 's my due.'' jesus grabbed Ivan by neck and slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside window grew from silent drone into frenzy, and jesus smiled evil drawing his face closer to his Judas.`` In blood the brand is drawn.'' nyarlahotep drew the blade he was hiding also slashed Ivan 's wrist spluttering drops of blood on wall. He watched in delight as drops spread several linking up also continuing their intricate design; it was composed of a crude circle with entertaining tentacles also pair of piercing eyes.`` There'' He said.`` Done.'' Next, he tossed Ivan. Meanwhile, He landed next to brother window also as he peered out of it he clearly saw the glowing heads and beating wings of the go their forms slightly covered by rain that began to autumn again.`` Enjoy your trip Judas.'' Great, nyarlahotep said. For although I am done with you you always serve a purpose.'' mio swarmed the window scattering like paper, ivan barely had it 's time to scream as they worked on his skull amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.`` Cthulhu stage indeed.''
