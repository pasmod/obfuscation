﻿ Kann a democratic Spelling the English Language a Improvement?	﻿ Would a Spelling Reform of the English Language be an Improvement?
only in recent years have been linguists what there are vast differences between our two language. the	It is only in recent years that linguists have grasped what considerable differences there are between our two channels of language.
industrialized countries knowledge in a large extent , been enhanced by the tape-recorder (Milroy & Milroy, 1985).	To a large extent their improved knowledge has been promoted by the tape-recorder (Milroy & Milroy, 1985).
some of the industrialized countries differences confusion , as we still, known, also received a letter that he that , for so long to -p pronounced, as in the word receipt.	To give some examples of differences that may cause confusion we still, as is well known, preserve letters in our spelling that represent sounds which long ago ceased to be pronounced, such as -p in the word receipt.
he witnessed Distinctions , in the absence of distinction in pronounciation.	Distinctions are commonly made in spelling where there is no longer a distinction in pronounciation.
the peers sea/see and meat/meet simply of many even kind.	The pairs sea/see and meat/meet are only two out of many of the same kind.
the opposite so-called hand , we without being seen as a speech was , he writing.	On the opposite side we have got distinctions that have emerged in speech without any trace of it to be seen in writing.
Think for example , in which he singer and finger. -ng	Think for example of the spelling -ng in singer and finger.
the correct same. Laut	It is the exact same.
it is represented ? diphthongs we represent , they can , one often letter, as -i in mice.	When it comes to diphthongs we can often see them represented by a single letter, such as -i in mice.
that permanently Conversely, modern phonemes purely vowels sometimes as digraphs. represent	Conversely, modern phonemes that are definitely pure vowels can sometimes be represented by so called digraphs.
an example An digraph would be the -au the author of the question 1993). (Barber,	An example of a digraph would be the -au of author (Barber, 1993).
we have seen , there is a huge number of Unverträglichkeiten in English of a result , and replacement , the fact is spelling-pronounciations.	As we have seen then there is a great number of inconsistencies to be found in the English spelling system and one result of those inconsistencies is the prevalence of so called spelling-pronounciations.
if a word thesis is a new pronounciation by the influence of (ibid). it	These arise when a word is given a new pronounciation through the influence of its spelling (ibid).
for example , which is the recovery in often. -t common	One example of this is the rather common re-introduction of -t in often.
Like (1993:202) Barber promising spelling-pronounciations , especially when "universal education , and the proliferation of ; and newspapers , is in a form that their houses never very environment".	According to Barber (1993:202) spelling-pronounciations are particularly likely to appear when "universal education and the wide dissemination of books and newspapers introduce people to words in printed form which they have never heard pronounced in their home environment".
in other words , it is that foreign auszusprechenden will , to the 'wrong' way, for natives of the other side more in problems , because there are so many of it. spelling, incoherence	In other words it is quite likely that foreigners will pronounce words in the 'wrong' way, whereas natives on the other hand are more likely to have difficulties when in comes to spelling, since there are so many inconsistencies in it.
the second group of people at any moment are the possibilities of functioning words. 'correct'	The latter group of people are continuously exposed to the 'correct' ways of pronouncing words.
Due all kinds of trouble then, sometimes it has proposed a reform of the English language would be a improvement.	Due to all the potential difficulties there are then, it has sometimes been suggested that a spelling reform of the English language would be an improvement.
in this essay my goal is whether such a reform or not debate and why. better	In this essay my intention is therefore to discuss whether such a reform is preferable or not and why.
I will be arguments for and against a it reform, , although the dominate. be	I will put forward arguments both in favour of and against a spelling reform, even though the latter ones are going to dominate.
I believe that it is important to powerful of launched direction. actions	I find it important to reflect upon implications of actions taken in either direction.
( EN ) – Like in the short term , and , in the long run , change if one perspective , it system?	What happens in the short term as well as in the long term perspective if we decide not to change the spelling system?
Afghan What will happen if we do?	What happens if we do?
I Before discussion in this sense , I paragraph, historical will, background. reader short .	Before I proceed to a discussion I will, in the following paragraph, give you the reader a brief historical background.
it is more Hopefully interesting and easy to follow.	Hopefully that will make things more interesting and easy to follow.
it Today, in the twentieth century, almost entirely invariant.	Today, in the twentieth century, spelling is almost absolutely invariant.
on though, Earlier in the Middle East , and Modern Early English, a few alternatives acceptable. were	Earlier on though, in both Middle and Early Modern English, a limited number of alternatives were acceptable.
he has been strongest reason Informal common in the eighteenth century adoptionswillige spellings and a little different would be in the work of every Schriftsteller (Barber, 1993).	Informal spelling was actually fairly common as late as in the eighteenth century and rather surprisingly different spellings could be seen even within the work of each writer (Barber, 1993).
Milroy and Milroy (1985) on the fact that the idea of a system recent. absolutely firmly it	Milroy and Milroy (1985) both stresses the fact that the idea of an absolutely fixed spelling system is recent.
in particular , They spellings words now as way acceptable and other 'errors'. spellings be rejected .	They state that particular spellings of words nowadays are regarded as uniquely acceptable and that other possible spellings are being rejected as 'errors'.
it is mean, important, consider the are accepted arbitrary and the forms of convention.	It is important, they mean, to bear in mind that the accepted forms are arbitrary and fixed by convention.
the amendment spellings to be logic as others.	No spellings are in themselves more logical than others.
a Barber (1993) Like in the language is acceptable excluded are always more diverse will be down. explicitly	According to Barber (1993) a ruled language is one in which acceptable usage is explicitly laid down.
He in some linguists described as in the past , we believe that rules changing. language	He describes in detail how certain linguists in the past used to believe that rules and regulations would prevent the language from changing.
as everyone However, today, every language is used that a perpetual state change.	However, as is generally known today, every language that is being used is in a perpetual state of change.
in comparison with pronounciation it here, naturally, is the single language (Milroy always more diverse Milroy, 1985). &	In comparison with pronounciation spelling is here, naturally, the most uniform level of language usage (Milroy & Milroy, 1985).
Since, then, perpetual on the proposed English resolution of pronounciation has resulted in a quantity of incoherence of on our writing, some aquire to people in spelling. a	Since, then, the above discussed perpetual motion of the English pronounciation has led to a vast quantity of inconsistencies in our writing, it is getting increasingly hard for people to aquire proficiency in spelling.
thus , must be taken seriously , in a society with a strong emphasized rightly literacy.	This should be taken seriously in a society where great emphasis is placed on literacy.
given that is important , correctly. today clearly	It is regarded as highly important today being able to spell correctly.
this aspect Looking isolated it evokes a reform of the English language motivated. could	Looking upon this aspect in isolation a spelling reform of the English language could be motivated.
as he once , is, however, pronounciation of fully to change and is urgently needed that we ask itself if it truly improvement.	As previously established there is, however, nothing that can prevent pronounciation from continuously changing and accordingly you should ask yourself whether it would actually be that much of an improvement.
it would be a In well for our future pronounciation, changes radicals , because reinforces , by more would make sense for way.	In one way it might be good for us in the future to recognise radical changes in pronounciation, since writing would make much more sense that way.
as the current system , it is well reform in my opinion, would, however, and as a else.	As long as the present spelling system works out fairly well a reform would, however, in my opinion, be a disservice rather than anything else.
as Milroy and Milroy (1985) many important point is our access to history writing.	As Milroy and Milroy (1985) much importantly point out our access to history is mainly through writing.
In for embassies and be transposed within the way in a clear sign undeniable and it is essential that , as possible. system is so uniform	In order for messages to be transmitted over time and distance in a clear and unambiguous manner it is essential that the spelling system is as uniform as possible.
it is cushion , long-term In dangerous, run, obstruct interpretation on. documents, books .	In other words it is dangerous, in the long run, to obstruct interpretation of preserved documents, books and so on.
we our inheritance. cultural	We have got to look after our cultural inheritance.
( in ) There has also practical problems of reform , that it should consideration.	There are some practical problems as well with a spelling reform that should be taken into consideration.
first , all people from several generations would be almost trained opinions on the new rules.	First of all people from different generations would almost certainly have formed different opinions about the new rules.
In long enough likely we a mixture of different types of spelling, and a irony , because he even more difficult.	For quite a long period of time we would very likely see a mixture of different kinds of spelling, which is all rather ironic since it would make spelling even more difficult.
probably The can systems past, non-standardised he and I once for. accounted	The result could probably be compared with the non-standardised spelling systems of the past, which I have previously accounted for.
the younger generation Assuming would be aligned with new system, would be their curriculum also in the future on interpretation and former Article documents. books, and	Assuming that the younger generation would be more likely to welcome the new system, it would also be more difficult for them in the future to interpret and use old books, articles and documents.
industrialized countries discussion it might also create a useless between different groups of society, in my view , is very impreferable.	To take that discussion one step further it could also create unnecessary gaps between different groups of society, which I think is highly impreferable.
the Barber (1993) many different pronounciation can be explained that we both geographical, social and situational factors.	Barber (1993) describes how the many differences in pronounciation that we have can be explained by both geographical, social and situational factors.
this Taking it would be a little difficult be adopterez changes in the case of a reform. it	Taking this into account it would be rather difficult to decide on exactly what changes that would be made in the event of a spelling reform.
the power to control have Who is to decide what pronounciations recognize , in particular writing?	Who is to have the authority to make decisions about what particular pronounciations that are to be recognised in writing?
what it is possible , a conclusion managed , without 'correct' subjective?	How is it possible to arrive at a conclusion about what is 'correct' without being subjective?
this is where the pronounciations of a fairly large, selected, group of society. .	What we would witness would be a recognition of the pronounciations used by a rather large, but selected, group of society.
this comparison that , in the convention of the English language Mittelalters was a small minority.	This could be compared with the fact that Standard English in the late Middle Ages was the language of a small minority.
the best sozioökonomischer at the level of speakers, closest to your speech , was (Barber, 1993). norm English	The higher the socio-economic level of the speakers, the nearer their speech was likely to be to Standard English (Barber, 1993).
over this period , is that we the the language, called that now as extremely recognized (ibid).	It is from that period that we have inherited the prescriptive attitudes towards language, that today ought to be regarded as highly influential (ibid).
not change exaggerated, are numerous spread, pronounciation not either. neglected .	The problem should not be exaggerated, since many changes in pronounciation are widely spread, but should not be neglected either.
every language People's use extremely complex.	People's use of any language is highly complex.
often , is that English is very conservative, but a series of good reasons why.	It is often stated that the English language is highly conservative, but there seem to be a lot of good reasons why.
if I them short what we in this essay obviously , there is more problems , as benefits of the same reform, it to everyone's sake, we will conservative.	If we sum up what I have discussed in this essay there are obviously more problems than there are benefits with the suggested spelling reform, so for everyone's sake, let us stay conservative.

as a future Weltlehrer don't as I a word on the reduction of concerns studies, but I believe that the impact on a great danger that a reduction of durchgreifende teachers' competence , and also the norm schools. sill ” in Swedish	As a future teacher I don't see a point in reducing the subject studies, but in fact I consider the reduction to be a great threat that would lead to a radical lowering of the teachers' competence and moreover the standard of the basic training at Swedish schools.
the idea, , through projects of restructuring on, rests teachers and more the intermediary role in the classroom, it would be but for students their own knowledge.	The idea, which the plan of the restructuring is based on, is that the teachers would no more have the intermediary role in the classroom, but they would be there to guide the pupils to find their own knowledge.
the commission of education Teachers' Therefore argues that it's superfluous , the topic for the future of professors , however , are half studies moment, enough. would be	Therefore the Teachers' Education Committee thinks that it's unnecessary to have as much subject education for the future teachers as they have at the moment, but half the subject studies would be enough.
as Weltlehrer students Instead attract attention on issues like the knowledge and organized. how	Instead the teacher students would devote themselves to issues such as how the knowledge is formed and how it can be organized.
as high lecturer and as a Weltlehrer take Arne Hellden of Linkoping in his article to Dagens Nyheter (May 10, 2000), vague. ill-defined , and it seems that the proposal	As senior lecturer and teacher trainer Arne Hellden from Linkoping expresses in his article in Dagens Nyheter (May 10, 2000), the proposal appears very ill-defined and vague.
where is School students learn to develop and themselves, isn't it?	School is still a place where pupils are supposed to learn things and develop themselves, isn't it?
Like something to learn the lessons , if no one them? ’	How can they learn anything if there is nobody to convey the knowledge to them?
the view that the guides teachers and students transferred from knowledge with certainly very much a in theory, and it in practice , but a catastrophe.	The view of the teachers being guides while the pupils explore and search out the knowledge by themselves certainly looks nice on a paper and sounds good in theory, but in practice it would lead to a catastrophe.
too many In , which are not loans , the great responsibility for their own the Teachers' education Committee's proposal requires.	There are too many pupils who are not ready to take the enormous responsibility for their own learning which the Teachers' Education Committee's suggestion requires.
students like a Weltlehrer , a person, clearly shows that implementing the basis of knowledge and development, for their chances of other education.	The pupils need a person, a teacher who conveys the basic knowledge that lays the foundation of their knowledge development, and creates opportunities for their further education.
industrialized countries be able to act as a intermediary, teachers clearly teach. must know how	To be able to act as an intermediary, teachers will definitely need to know how to teach.
it doesn't However, support on the state promotions , without teach. something	However, it doesn't help to be professional in knowing how to teach without having something to teach.
industrialized countries sensitive education half teachers' would be competence, , and she took the main duty as a Weltlehrer as "agent" among students and knowledge.	To half the subject education would drastically decrease teachers' competence, and make them incapable to fulfil the most important duty of a teacher as an "agent" between the pupils and the knowledge.
the “ good ” Both knowledge and skills , appeasement is large parts of the teachers' competence.	Both the thorough knowledge of the subject and the know-how of teaching are important parts of the teachers' competence.
the others other one, , but a balance between them found. should	The other should not exclude the other one, but a balance between them should be found.
education programs Teachers' in a difficult task to adapt to change that both inside and outside school.	Teachers' education programs have in general a difficult duty to adjust to the changes that go on both in and outside of the school.
programs , at the same time , a vital role in changing the workplace as Weltlehrer school. developed .	At the same time the programs have an extremely important role in changing the teacher profession and thus developing the school.

we understand that these changes shouldn't disastrous consequences in heels, all, and the largest voice of those who should be ideas in second practice.	We shouldn't make changes that have such disastrous consequences head over heels, and above all, the biggest voice should be given those who then afterwards should put the ideas into practice.

﻿ Let homosexuellen adopt children! couples	﻿ Let homosexual couples adopt children!
the Dagens Nyheter 99-09-27 an article against couples homosexuellen , that the right , children.	In the Dagens Nyheter 99-09-27 there was an article that argued against homosexual couples having the right to adopt children.
the arguments used to the best child adopted, was a point of view , I am agree but then , I found with, its arguments invalid.	The arguments that were used concentrated on what was best for the child that was to be adopted, a viewpoint I completely agree with, but I found their arguments to be invalid.
Firstly, shouldn't are approved , because they are of their lives, difficulties in the adoption of homosexuellen parents.	Firstly, that children shouldn't be adopted since they will have difficulties in their lives, if adopted by homosexual parents.
this legitimate Secondly, take could be Sweden , because the majority of biological mothers or accounting for Waisen don't give for their children , adoption of couples. homosexuellen	Secondly, that legitimate adoptions to Sweden might decrease since the majority of the biological mothers or representatives for orphans don't want to give their child up for adoption to homosexual couples.
the test Thirdly , the lives of adopted. children	Thirdly that there should be no more experimenting with the lives of children that are adopted.
the arguments may seem context, recognized , but I voterai against this article say in order to show that couples homosexuellen , will not be less than we build heterosexual are. parents couples	These arguments might seem valid when out of the context, but I will argue against this article in order to show that homosexual couples are not less suitable to be parents than heterosexual couples are.
industrialized countries with, start , it is not homosexuellen adopt couples children, , because these children are in times.	To begin with, it is argued that it is not right to let homosexual couples adopt children, since these children would go through hard times.
knows is not in Article what kind of problems and these children encounter, , but I believe that this argument problems concerns society, as mobbing or different kind of prejudice responses society regarding the configuration of the family of child.	It is not specified in the article what kind of problems and obstacles these children would encounter, but I believe that this argument concerns problems in society, such as mobbing or other kind of negative responses from society regarding the configuration of the family of the child.
each child Nevertheless, can put hard and , in any form of family, doesn't it a family , where parents homosexual.	Nevertheless, every child can face hard times and problems in every kind of family, it doesn't have to be a family where the parents are homosexual.
the Internet Joakim Anrell writes excessive magazine , if all problems family over the fact that parents homosexual.	Joakim Anrell writes in the Internet magazine that it is an exaggeration to blame all the problems in a family on the fact that the parents are homosexual.
He also that nothing , if it problems, some, by parents child's homosexuellen , not by other factor.	He also points out that there is nothing that indicates that problems, when there are some, are caused by the child's parents being homosexual and not by some other factor.
if he Furthermore, in the best interest child's shouldn't society in a situation can act as then desperate in adopting children farbigen justified? .	Furthermore, if it is in the child's best interest that society shouldn't put it in a situation where it can go through hard times how can then the adoption of coloured children be justified?
and even They harassed, racist , because there is opinions today. in Sweden	They too can go through hard times and even be harassed, since there are racist opinions in Sweden today.
given that he is clear that it is not only children , parents homosexuellen can live , as in argument times, then against adopting homosexuellen parents?	Since it is clear that it is not only children that live with homosexual parents that can go through hard times, how can it then be used as an argument against adoption by homosexual parents?
the second argument is what happens if homosexuellen children. couples to adopt	The second argument concerns what might happen if homosexual couples would be allowed to adopt children.
this is that the chances legitimate international take Sweden decrease, since homosexuellen couples , cannot as parents by countries that , children and the majority of mothers or accounting for Waisen don't a child , adopted by homosexuellen couples.	It is argued that the chances of legitimate international adoptions to Sweden might decrease, since homosexual couples are not accepted as parents by the countries that give up children for adoption and the majority of the mothers or representatives for orphans don't want to give a child up for adoption by homosexual couples.
it is important , good relations with other countries, but just as not a minority , sanctions and want's for family , children lucky world.	It is important to keep up good relations with other countries, but it is equally important not to discriminate a minority that can and want's to help take care of the less fortunate children of the world.
a solution to prevent problem, income can take international and the best of children good by our loving Assembly family, and could perhaps a homosexuellen couples on a small right children.	A solution to this problem, to both prevent a possible decrease in international adoptions and see too the best of the children by providing them with a good home and a loving family, could perhaps be accomplished by allowing homosexual couples a limited right to adopt children.
these start the people who , a child from decide whether they by the hetero- or homosexuellen parents.	This could be done in such a way that the persons that give up a child for adoption may decide whether they want the child to be adopted by hetero- or homosexual parents.
the number of children made for adopting by homosexuellen couples limited, , but it is as a few children not a good home.	The number of children given up for adoption by homosexual couples would of course be limited, but this way a few more children could get a good home.
borders had What countries take Sweden, , but it would be a akzeptables compromise, at least for the period being.	Perhaps the limitation wont prevent the countries from stopping adoptions to Sweden, but it would be an acceptable compromise, at least for the time being.
this border could be removed later , when the company agreed , the family parents. homosexuellen	This limitation could later be removed when society has accepted families that consist of homosexual parents.
the third and final argument , it should not procedure test the lives of children adopted. ,	The third and final argument states that there should be no more experimenting with the lives of the children that are adopted.
given that the argument isn't further that it is hard to what it is what it means it.	Since the argument isn't further developed it is hard to see what is meant by it.
I suppose that a child is homosexuellen parents what it is in this case experimenting.	I assume that giving a child homosexual parents is what in this case is meant by experimenting.
In , an amendment on the in Reichstag Andreas Carlgren writes that in a study of the University of Gothenburg for children grow up with homosexuellen parents , this is not the configuration of family , but most, of the child is children , and what kind of support society. to signal in	In a motion to the Swedish Parliament Andreas Carlgren writes that in a study conducted by the university of Gothenburg concerning children growing up with homosexual parents concluded that it is not the configuration of the family which affects the child most, instead it is how the children are raised and what kind of support they receive in society.
this argument , it is also accepts with heterosexual melting thesis parents – all the other people have been studied carefully before the child.	This argument also suggests that it has been accepted to experiment with heterosexual parents - These have all been different individuals who have been investigated thoroughly before being allowed to adopt a child.
( in ) It not what has heterosexual families , after a few years, it the baby properly manage couldn't , and perhaps abusive, was the child , and they have been the parents a chance.	There is no way of knowing what happened to those heterosexual families after a few years, perhaps they couldn't take care of the child properly or perhaps they became abusive, still the child and the parents were given a chance.
not even Homosexuals ’ exemption from adoption and must be examined , and I believe that the right to everyone.	Homosexuals are not even allowed to apply for adoption and be examined and I believe that that right should apply to everyone.
Only that way , it is possible , the best parents to a child.	Only this way it is possible to find the best possible parents to a child.
In conclusion, couples homosexuellen , to adopt children , but he may beginning.	In conclusion, homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children but that right should perhaps be limited in the beginning.
Every child in every type of family life and this debate is therefore not against homosexuellen couples.	Every child in every kind of family might go through hard times and this argument can therefore not be used against homosexual couples.
children Decreasing chances heterosexuals could , even if the result of for couples homosexuellen children. adopt	Decreasing chances to adopt children also for heterosexuals could be the result if homosexual couples would be allowed to adopt children.
the risk of a society of That take.	That is a risk society should be willing to take.
( in ) It , mother , their child is adopted , these children could with people live the Versuchsphase wouldn't , with their lives.	There are mothers that agree to their child being adopted by homosexuals and letting these children live with to people of the same sex wouldn't be to experiment with their lives.
a study of the University of Gothenburg shows that the current constellation of the family , less than is important , as the child and society. of	A study made by the university of Gothenburg shows that the constellation of the family is less important than how the child is raised and how it is supported by society.

so I have Like proposes the introduction in a year of S. Grundtvig of a mandatory country. in other	What I am proposing is therefore the introduction during the last year of junior high school of a compulsory stay in a foreign country.
I propose that all Swedish MPs to spend S. Grundtvig students about a semester preferably in other countries outside the social Europe, to projects such as construction facing irrigation projects, schools, in cooperation with homelessness or women who , etc .	I suggest that all Swedish high school students spend approximately one semester in a foreign country preferably outside of Western Europe, taking part in social projects such as building schools, helping with irrigation projects, working with the homeless or in women shelters etc.
I propose of this project financed with taxes money.	I suggest this project be funded with tax money.
this idea in first seem unrealistic. convergence and radical	This idea might at first seem overly radical and somewhat unrealistic.
I soutiendrai the But by the taxpayers ’ money in favor of the project may not in the economic field , but also for the different , as well as for civil society large.	But I will here argue that the tax money spent on this project will pay back greatly maybe not so much in economical terms but in terms of gains for both the individual as well as for the society at large.
but since the risk as obsolete hopelessly idealist , I do not voterai in the economic situation (if also increase the any) or but for society , as the recipient proposal. would only benefit from students	With the risk of sounding as a hopelessly outdated idealist I will not start with the economical gains (if there indeed are any) or the gains for the society but with how the individual student would benefit from this proposal.
the first win is different , students growth. staff .	The first individual gain that come to mind is the students own personal growth.
What Afghan better yourself, responsibility and self-determination as fill on confidence and other cultures?	What better way to learn about yourself, learn responsibility and improve your self confidence than to travel and meet people from other cultures?

this area valuations this where, school seem to have debate, schools and need new ideas.	This is an area where, judging from the present school debate, schools seem to have difficulties and are in need of new ideas.
I believe that a compulsory semester spent abroad trying. is printed an innovation idea	I believe a compulsory semester spent abroad is an innovating idea worth trying.
Apart exposed by another culture of the students in order to another language.	Apart from being exposed to a different culture the students would also be exposed to a different language.
if highlight has plenty of linguistic knowledge , a job, I feel like a good investment for the different and civil society to learn S. Grundtvig to send students in a second language.	Today when a lot of stress is being put on language skills in order to get a job, I see it as a good investment both for the individual and for the society at large to early on learn high school students to communicate in a second language.
I believe it is critical Therefore at the beginning of each of these opportunity.	Therefore I think it is essential to make sure everybody gets this opportunity.
I springe today , too , the impact of this proposal proposed society. on	I will now move on to look at what positive effects this suggested proposal would have on society.
the big , is that it would help in the fight against racism.	One of the major gains that come to mind is that it would help in the fight against racism.
this is the only speculation , of course , my hand , but I feel a little logic as a result , if one in a phase at the beginning , other cultures and social situations.	This is of course only a speculation from my side but I see it as a rather logic result if people at an early age were to be confronted with other cultures and social situations.
poverty and I believe that it would be an effective instrument , to fight the rise of racism , but it is also , I hope , the consciousness of social Justice.	Not only do I think it would be an efficient way to meet the growing racism but it would hopefully also raise the awareness of the importance of social Justice.
I am not say that it is the only solution , but I believe that this is a two serious problems with our firm fights with today; racism and lack of interest in the global social Justice.	I am by no means suggesting this to be the only solution but I do think it to be one way of dealing with two substantial problems our society is struggling with today; racism and a lack of interest in global social Justice.
the borders of our own countries Looking it would also be positive that students country, received not only spectators can participate actively , but in the different projects.	Looking beyond our own country it would also be beneficial for the receiving country, taken that the students would not merely be spectators but would actively be taking part in the different projects.
given that any today , to must handelnde speculation economically , I remain that the idea is not only for the different and civil society can , however , are also economically sustainable.	Since everything today in order to be trustworthy has to be measured in economic terms I will venture to speculate that this idea is not only good for the individual and for society at large but can also be economically sustainable.
as we , of course , every day of qualified teachers, is the physical constraint Verfalls to achieve buildings of our schools , and the absence of day schoolbooks.	As good as every day we read about the scarcity of qualified teachers, the physical decay of our school buildings and the lack of updated schoolbooks.
since a large number of students (everyone in its final school) semester the level of demand abroad and professors schoolbooks decrease. would be	With a large number of students (everyone in their final semester of junior high school) abroad every year the demand for schoolbooks and teachers would decrease.
of course In a necessity teachers , then that into contact with students abroad and home to follow coming.	There would of course still be a need for some teachers to keep in contact with the students while abroad and to follow up at home coming.
quite the number of paid could But reduced.	But the actual number of teachers could be reduced.
, too , is my conviction that this last "abroad spent" semester would be a for students to stop S. Grundtvig , and thus the number of dropouts would be reduced.	It is also my conviction that this last "abroad spent" semester would be a good incentive for students to finish junior high school and therefore the number of dropouts would be reduced.
Which not only for the different students participants would guarantee also on the economy is for more than people full school and makes market.	Which apart from being good for the individual students also would have a good effect on the economy since more people would complete their studies and be more attractive on the job market.
I believe , as the you have seen , many good reasons, for society and students of introduction of the remain obligatory for students held in young school. high from abroad .	As you have seen I believe there to be many good reasons, both for society and for the students to introduce a compulsory stay abroad for the students in junior high school.
I have also how , could economy, a reduction , although I lack of education financial and makes these preconditions speculative.	I have even suggested in what way this could have a beneficial effect on the economy, even though my lack of economic training makes these assumptions rather speculative.
I believe , even if But we, conducive to these idea, , both the to raise taxes and school society, students from that it would be good it. printed	But I believe that even if we, in order to implement this idea, would have to increase the taxes both the society, the school and the students have enough to gain that it would be well worth it.

( in ) It is because many examples of , the causes of violence in our Sweden, and , in this essay, that I soutiendrai the three and a coherent particularly causes conclusion.	There exist many examples concerning the causes for the increased violence among adolescents in Sweden, and in this essay, I will present the three most credible causes and give a conclusion.
the debate Firstly, if violent influence of some children in the long topical. negative sense	Firstly, the debate whether or not violent television programmes influence children in a negative way has long been topical.
the child In some not concerned , while others impressionable children , not fiction reality. distinct	Some argue that the child is not affected whereas others argue that children are impressionable and cannot separate fiction from reality.
I agree with the latter.	I have to agree with the latter.
in a “ Many children are safe precisely given the environment , many countries , where we need , a good role model to draw a distinction between law and wrong.	Many children grow up in insecure home environments where many lack a satisfactory role model to teach them to distinguish between right and wrong.
not what the small children , and that the elderly , children do not understand that the some real. programs	One could argue that only small children are affected and that older children can understand that the television programmes are not real.
I agree this, , however , in another point consideration.	I agree with this, however one must take another aspect into consideration.
only a show that there is a divergence programs with them , and more aggressions.	Violent programmes only show one way of solving problems and giving vent to aggressions.
Like Brostrom Lena frequently in the American governments Eskilstuna, involved in children , crime today in Sweden often families , where a good role model an alternative to the resolution television's not exist.	According to Lena Brostrom at the Police Department in Eskilstuna, the children who are involved in criminality in Sweden today often come from families where a satisfactory role model who should give an alternative to the television's way of solving problems does not exist.
the learn not Consequently as other tools to resolve violence.	Consequently the child does not learn other ways of solving problems than to use violence.
Secondly, today , we live in society is far more several years internationalised ago.	Secondly, the society we live in today is far more internationalised than it was several years ago.
the framework of globalization has been the reception of nuclear weapons , and drugs, and more easily of, received , that violence people. young people	The internationalisation has led to the entry of weapons and drugs, and the fact that this is easier to get hold of, has caused the violence to involve younger people.
knows is a fact that young people and so far weapons, Lena Brostrom, children working-age usually 17 use knives in young people on 17 guns. have	It is a fact that young people more than before possess weapons, and according to Lena Brostrom, children up to the age of 17 mostly use knives whereas young people over the age of 17 have guns.
as cigarettes and alcohol Drugs, by children are the age of 12 15 and simple and you received tried, – often slight shift to a serious often drugs in criminality. leads	Drugs, such as cigarettes and alcohol are used by children at the early age of 12 to 15 and are easy to get hold of and once you have tried, it is often an easy transition to use harder drugs which often leads one into criminality.
our society of Furthermore, segregated, typically due to high unemployment , and Sweden not greater prosperity state.	Furthermore, our society has become segregated, mostly due to the great unemployment years and Sweden is no longer the same welfare state.
with the information has a means, often with a parent households.	Society has become divided with areas consisting of people of limited means, often with one parent households.

in society more and more segregation, competitive.	In addition to the segregation, society is also becoming more competitive.
it is necessary to instance, In hard work to school for society. in	For instance, it is essential to work hard in school in order to do well in society.
children Lena Brostrom, Like in families , where parents have no role models, difficulties , so that they both inside and outside school.

They have lost their trust in the rights of clean environment adults, are often in one or abusers. both parents	They have lost their confidence in adults, often coming from home environments where one or both parents are drug abusers.
if their school , they are not up, sense that struggle.	If they fail in school they give up, feeling that it is no idea to struggle.
that many course, – is a new prospect of success in school since Sweden has a system of ausgewachsenen well-organized education, but these kids and not any possibility believe that it is useless.	Of course, many would argue that it is easy to get a new chance of succeeding in school since Sweden has a well organised system of adult education, but these children do not see any possibilities and feel that it is useless.
Moreover, indispensable , on the entire family , many families not very often faltering, succeed.	Moreover, it is essential for the entire family to take part and since the families are often faltering, many fail to succeed.
children must Thus, finally outside of society and an alternative possibility , clean and respect. one's	Thus, the children end up outside in society and need to find an alternative way to hold one's own and gain respect.
the answer is many, In violence and crime.	For many, the answer is violence and crime.
In conclusion, of the today is harder adolescents, and if it is not a &apos; environments, is easily in their home countries in trouble.	In conclusion, the society of today is hard on adolescents, and if they do not grow up in secure home environments, they easily get into trouble.
in my opinion, , indispensable to society at an early stage to respond to such negative development.	In my opinion, it is essential for society to react at an early stage in order to stop this negative development.
social services in this area and not the means limited.	The social services are insufficient in this field and the resources are too limited.
I believe that we must help children , which has already in school , the environment , because it is often in trouble. children	I believe that we have to start helping the children already in the school environment since it is often clear what children will get into trouble.
we must also from an improvement aid to angeschlagene families need.	We must also improve the help for faltering families in need.

Last time, in the end of 20th century, violence on TV was brought up in connection with the conflicts in some American schools where children opened fire on other children and teachers, and also with the cases in Europe and Scandinavia in which small children were killed by other children.
TV But is really a huge influence on children , unimaginable, terrible , other being?	But does TV really have such a powerful influence on children that might lead to such unimaginable, terrible acts as to kill another human being?
and if such influence has still , we can do something it?	And if it has such an influence is there anything we can do about it?

if we can't Even fully guilt TV for the terrible scenes of violence , nevertheless , it is important to their influence on the TV however, has is, a factor , because what we can do something about.	Even though we can't entirely blame TV violence for the horrible incidents that have happened it is still important to pay attention to the influence TV has because it is, however, a factor that we can do something about.
because there is no But, parents for all that their children in the televised the and radiodiffusion agree not , the violence in their programs, is: : we can do?	But, because there is no way for parents to control everything what their children are watching on TV and the broadcasters are most likely not going to reduce violence in their programs, the question is: what are we able to do?
I believe that we should not exclude violence against the children of all kinds of TV.	I believe that we would achieve nothing by trying to exclude children from all possible violence on TV.
first , all should not have fill and , second , children , more generally , anyway violence, because, everywhere, , that we appeals or not, violence and still is part of our reality.	First of all it is impossible and secondly children would anyway meet violence, generally speaking everywhere, because, whether we like it or not, violence is and has always been a part of our reality.
the only solution constructive in my view , is more information about children TV, such as programs and beneficial in many cases of fraud and series. films	The only constructive solution in my opinion is to give children more information about TV, how the different kinds of programs are made and how they use a lot of tricks in films and series.

I believe , schools , a very important role in information televised of children and violence, in education and Kostenabrechnung and, in use , on the whole, , on the bulk of information as they TV.	I believe that schools have a very important role in informing children about TV and violence, in teaching them to estimate and select and, on the whole, to handle the tremendous amount of information that they get from TV.
the effektivste that, for schools , in my opinion, in belehrenden media. in	The most effective way for schools to do that, in my opinion, would be to introduce instruction in media.
I believe that even regulators radiodiffusion must be the responsibility. their	I think that even the broadcasters should take their share of the responsibility.
Quite much depends on their own moral, arrangements for , say , on how much and what kind of violence they when children as TV. lead	Quite a lot depends on their own moral, that they make up rules for themselves for example concerning how much and what kind of violence they show at the time when children most likely watch TV.
Above all, entstellen not the consequences of the violence in TV, but the real ones.	Above all, they should not misrepresent the consequences of the violence on TV, but to show the real ones.
.	.
the greater responsibility in my view , the children of education on these issues that still in parents.	In my opinion the biggest responsibility of giving children the education on these matters is still vested in parents.
it is important that the discuss, realistic and the fiction violence and that their consequences, with their children, work together fears of not having or situation uncertain , that children violence.

It is important that they discuss, both the realistic and the fiction violence and also their consequences, with their children, that they work up together any fears or suspense that children might have due to TV violence.

Most , violence against children somehow. concerns TV .	Most people believe that violence on TV affects children somehow.
I believe TV both positive and negative impact on children typically because of its ability , with material derived from that they TV.	I think that TV can have both good and bad influence on children mostly due to their ability to handle the information that they get from TV.
in particular is broadcasters' schools', and, all, parents' responsibility , to ensure that the lessons of difference between the children fiction, and the true consequences of domestic violence and forced acts, , and their wrong.	It is schools', broadcasters' and, above all, parents' responsibility to make sure that children learn the difference between fact and fiction, that they get aware of the real consequences of violent acts, and to build up their sense of right and wrong.

industrialized countries , they can superiority, excellent governesses necessary , and especially for their children, sons, school.	To be able to ensure this superiority, they needed excellent governesses to prepare their children, and especially sons, for school.
this demand in an electoral college for the creation governesses, and what it is necessary that women also paid education, and the entire system for girls insufficient. was schooling	This demand resulted in the founding of a college for educating governesses, and once this was established it was evident that also women teachers needed further education, and that the whole system for girls schooling was insufficient.
Another category of women is for education and other reformers. feminists	Another category arguing strongly for formal female education was that of feminists and other reformers.
They oberflächlichen education , useless. far entirely .	They claimed that the superficial education given was completely useless.
women have equal education as men. norms	Women should have the right to the same standards of education as men.

I Another that Mrs will support the EU in this endeavor if it is married.	Another point they made was that an educated woman would be able to support herself if she never married.
if these two groups Even had strong arguments , develop the largest number of women education, arguments against the opinions of women education.	Even though these two groups had strong arguments and actually managed to develop female education, the greatest number of arguments represents the opinion against female education.

(Ellis p.6) Among all those ideas opposing that women undertake the same higher education as men there was the common belief that men and women had different, innate, intellectual qualities, and that women simply were not meant to interfere with politics or other things that demanded constructive thinking.
Both between men and women , we support these belief, this from a woman: "There is a natural inferiority with women in (...) intellect , we are under your feet, , because we cannot give our own."	Both men and women supported this belief, we can tell from this quotation from a woman: "There is a natural inferiority of mind in women - of the intellect (...) we are under your feet, because we cannot stand upon our own."

this idea has been supported anatomical Something modern other studies, or perhaps even more conclusions anthropologists them, intelligence pure has also been in relations with the size and the rule of the brain.	Something else supporting this idea was contemporary anatomical studies, or perhaps even more the conclusions anthropologists drew from them, that intelligence was in proportion to the size and weight of the brain.

as we are all men's know, Fernsehnachrichten more powerful , and more forcefully than women's and so , what women as men. mentally "proved" less developed	As we all know, men's brains are larger and heavier than women's and so it was "proved" that women were less mentally developed than men.
this argument , By that Mrs should not the same education as men, , because it did not the possibility of it.	By this argument they wanted to show that woman should not undertake the same education as men, because she did not have the capacity to do it.

the abandoned or not? ﻿ Legalisation	﻿ Legalisation of narcotics or not?
the question of whether or not abandoned to allow heated have been discussed in many years.	The matter of whether to legalise narcotics or not has been lively discussed for many years.
even if fact, , there is still an important question not current lately ignored, especially on the use abandoned the teenagers, as "weekend-ecstasy".	Despite that fact, it is still a current subject of importance not to be ignored, especially due to the lately increasing use of narcotics by the teenagers, as a "weekend-ecstasy".
this question is complex selected discuss, why I three central themes focus on: Kann , so that we urge and less claims , if drugs , where legalised? narcotics,	This is a rather complex topic to discuss, why I have chosen three main subjects to concentrate on:   Would the curiosity decrease and lead to less use of narcotics, if the drugs where legalised?
Sinn &apos;s for every their own decision or not , as long as would have suffer?	Is it up to every single individual to make their own decision whether to use drugs or not - while no one else would have to suffer?
society costs without end already on the use of alcohol, why the legal alcohol not? , if	The society already has huge costs referring to the use of alcohol, so why would alcohol be legal if narcotics are not?
I am very curious. Personally,	Personally, I find myself to be quite curious.
I would also my own decisions as individual.	I also want to make my own decisions as an individual.
I firmly But that the legalization of abandoned would be a terrible and pointless to achieve Verfalls Swedish society.	But still I am very determined that the legalisation of narcotics would lead to a terrible and unnecessary decay of the Swedish society.
if I with Even narcotics, review , where I do not think that I would be if it legal. with less	Even if I where curious enough to test narcotics, I do not believe I would be less curious if it was legal.
I believe that the so-called increase , I would my possibility narcotics, tried , because it would be much simpler it. received	On the contrary I think the legalisation would increase my possibility of trying narcotics, because it would be much easier to get hold of it.
perhaps to. Laut fallen substantially	It would probably be considerably cheaper to.
I would A the message evil "narcotics cannot forget that they - after all, accepted", even more , citizens , one of narcotics. liberal	A legalisation would actually bring the message that "narcotics can not be that bad - after all, it is accepted", which would make even more people have a liberal view of narcotics.
I am sure you on an increase in the deployment of many it, studies. psychological	I am sure that would definitely lead to an increase of the use of it, according to many psychological studies.
as the mental view, From inching it seems important that you, as individual, have the opportunity that you montrerez your decision live , as your life.	From another psychological point of view, it seems to be rather important that you, as an individual, feel that you have the possibility to make your own decision how to live your life.
I agree, until your action no negative impact on other people.	I agree, as long as your actions do not have a negative effect on other people.
But only attract attention to the fact that some "every is the argument that the right to their own choices abandoned or if not" is not sustainable legal. argument should be abandoned , why	But this is just the point that makes the argument that "every individual has the right to make their own choice whether to take narcotics or not" is not a durable argument why narcotics should be legal.
I believe with drugs People ’ s Republic of really "up them", , no one other suffer.	People might think that using drugs is really "up to them", no one else has to suffer.
this is certainly not true. But	But that is certainly not true.
the many damage from drugs. have effects easily	The whole society suffers of many effects that could easily be referred to drugs.
A part of the crime and health-care-costs and the costs of the lately a number of teenager people on the basis of need psychological support on implementation of the somewhat new, and ecstasy drug, young people very populär are just a few examples effects. perverse	A considerable part of the criminality and health-care-costs and the costs of treating the lately escalating number of adolescent people who need psychological help due to the use of the rather new, and among youths very popular drug, ecstasy are just a few examples of the negative effects.
the worst consequences of using their impact of the user's regarding the social think. one, I	The worst effect of how the use of narcotics effects people in the user's surrounding is the social one, I think.
the best My friend's brother has been abandoned type (he 36 today). is more than 13 .	My best friend's brother has been using narcotics of different kind since he was about 13 (he is 36 today).
He never a responsibility adult, mature, succeed , even if it Zurückdrängung society--drug use its (one , it is if , for development in the adolescent). mental	He will never become a mature, responsible adult, even if he would succeed in getting rid of his addiction to drugs (one of the effects of hashish is that it stops the psychological development if used during the adolescent).
but drugs Seine family's the lives of many dramatic does. ways,	His use of drugs has effected his whole family's life in many tragic ways, and it still does.
the argument that Unluckily, , everyone must have the possibility of their own choice, over legalization of narcotics, often as a major young people , for their process independent and free individuals.	Unluckily, the argument that every single person must have the possibility to make their own choice, advocating for legalisation of narcotics, is often considered to be one of the most attractive to the youths during their process to become free and independent individuals.
the common responses , as I already indicated above, argument is that the alcohol is a key reasons for this type of problems.	One of the common replies to such an argument as I have mentioned above, is that alcohol also is one of the main reasons to this kind of problems.
if alcohol legal, "So, , why not abandoned be", the easier for legalization say. would be abandoned	"So, if alcohol is legal, why should not narcotics be", the advocates of the legalisation of narcotics would say.
a But, horrifying Fehlers entitle not to other one.	But, making one terrible mistake does not entitle us to make another one.
it is true that we already many alcohol, in our society , owing to the sad enough.	It is true that we do already have a lot of trouble in our society due to alcohol, which is sad enough.
I do not believe But with the alcohol illegal, though, here , too , because the traditional roots in our history and I believe that this tradition of Gedenkfeier for example, with, to , a toast someone who have a particular incidence occasion, would thus makes change.	But I do not believe in making alcohol illegal, though, because the use of it has such deep traditional roots in our history and I think this tradition with, for example, the ceremony to drink a toast to someone on a special occasion, would therefore be extremely difficult to change.
the decomposition Another using alcohol is much more quickly , as for instance. marijuana	Another point is that the decomposition of alcohol is much faster than that of marijuana for instance.
Marijuana likely to remain in the pregnant about 30 days.	Marijuana may remain in the body up to about 30 days.
it would not be That in most , even in weekends, abandoned , if it will control over time work. intoxicated	That would make it impossible to most people to actually use narcotics even in the weekends, if they are not going to be intoxicated during their time at work.
if their in a alcoolisée that night evening, using alcohol , on Saturday , you can be safe , in the Monday free to morning.	If you drink alcohol in a Saturday evening, you can be pretty sure to be free from it in the Monday morning.
if you But destroyed a common policy of the marijuana, never know if you "flashbacks" no time to in the next 30 days or not.	But if you smoke a joint of marijuana, you will never know if you are going to have "flashbacks" any time in the following 30 days or not.
I do not think that for the legalization of abandoned would be carried out by a doctor marijuana, ecstasy intoxicated or any other drug.	I do not think that even advocates for the legalisation of narcotics would like to be operated by a doctor intoxicated by marijuana, ecstasy or any other drug.
as I already above, in society has already many different Überschwemmungsproblemen by drugs kinds. different	As I mentioned above, the whole society suffers already in many different ways due to drugs of different kinds.
the Legalisation abandoned , because there is even worse, who suffer , the use of narcotics.	Legalisation of narcotics would make that suffering even worse, because it would increase the use of narcotics.
as is not true that the drug are not all other people. effects	It is also certainly not true that the drug-users do not effect any other people.
the gap should be , given that the alcohol is admitted legally cannot as a sustainable argument either.	The argument that narcotics ought to be legal because alcohol is legal can not be taken as a durable argument either.
we want if their in a society , people are a &apos; in harmony and empathetic and responsible for other people, is not to adults , that we must ensure that will be in this category Sweden. legalised	If we wish a society where most people are given the possibility to grow up in harmony and become empathetic and responsible adults who cares about other people, we have to make sure that narcotics will never be legalised here in Sweden.
