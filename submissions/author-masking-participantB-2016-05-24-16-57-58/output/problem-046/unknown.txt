 An idea of social justice Lehrplänen In racism increasingly a time between young and words like social justice seems our vocabulary erased , it is critical , what is the role of school in the framework of this debate , and the creation attitudes.I believe that schools can and should play a more active role for social justice , back on the agenda.so I have Like proposes the introduction in a year of S. Grundtvig of a mandatory country. in otherI propose that all Swedish MPs to spend S. Grundtvig students about a semester preferably in other countries outside the social Europe, to projects such as construction facing irrigation projects, schools, in cooperation with homelessness or women who , etc .I propose of this project financed with taxes money.this idea in first seem unrealistic. convergence and radicalI soutiendrai the But by the taxpayers ’ money in favor of the project may not in the economic field , but also for the different , as well as for civil society large.but since the risk as obsolete hopelessly idealist , I do not voterai in the economic situation (if also increase the any) or but for society , as the recipient proposal. would only benefit from studentsthe first win is different , students growth. staff .What Afghan better yourself, responsibility and self-determination as fill on confidence and other cultures?I believe that it is not only schools of ambition students , the facts , but also to other initiatives , such as the skills and group.this area valuations this where, school seem to have debate, schools and need new ideas.I believe that a compulsory semester spent abroad trying. is printed an innovation ideaApart exposed by another culture of the students in order to another language.if highlight has plenty of linguistic knowledge , a job, I feel like a good investment for the different and civil society to learn S.
