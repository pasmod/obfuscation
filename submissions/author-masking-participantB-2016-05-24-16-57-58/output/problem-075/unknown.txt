 used , on the death penalty Before Amnesty International , I am I large penalty. on the death penaltyI know , if I didn't for or against the punishment.Now I know that I am against the death penalty punishment.My belief is based on three arguments against the death penalty penalty: can't , to show that it's die killing, wrong , and cannot be accused of not the death penalty as deterrent.I believe that every understand that the parents of the victims , which relies on the people were killed , but I don't member, their families its citizens a state can do that something wrong , we conformant but exactly the same in the name of group law.the government and let and over. shouldn't of emotionsthis is a People ’ s Republic of loss, on the other hand, aren't clearly. powerwe must understand On of these people feel , but I believe that the government don't , to show that for their citizens assassination some them.we must not forget that we that we can't someone assassination else. love for someoneI believe it's to observe that the horrific crimes committed by the people , but this should punished, with other Strafbestimmungen for example , when life sentence punishment.it produces often argument of people , for the death penalty is much cheaper to a criminal , or it , as life. him into custodyThat not true, though.knows is that , ultimately , the process vorausgehen , the death penalty is much more expensive than any punishment.if the process very close Even are still only judged. guiltythe majority of US sentenced to death detainees are lived black , in their lives poverty.can't Poor people and provide the best Jurist can wrongfully convicted.the possibility of a man innocent die reason penalty. against the death penaltythe government in can't losses , he has the innocent family. person'sin these cases , there is only a victim was not solved. of problems .death penalty People ’ s Republic of here is that the only people everywhere crimes. of ( in )this argument is not as either.in countries where they always capital punishment amounts of serious close Delikten more important than in countries , these punishment. don'tI believe that this fact that the death penalty as deterrent. doesn't activityI believe that life is better to execution of the death penalty penalty.I am favorable to life , because I believe that the death penalty don't or their parents of the victims of a criminal should fear that have been harassed again. could causeI am also supported this type of punishment , because if it seems that it has condemned , he or she is innocent, alive. remainsif you Even can't pay for years has lagged bars, innocent people can live the rest of life can't let me you in freedom of the person do.I believe that the best thing that may not by a society citizens Panikstimmung crimes, crime. to commit .an example , as it could be accomplished through a better and school system.this is of course very expensive, but if we the death penalty it. in my view ,is not always easy to penalty. against the death penaltyyou represented ? on people die violence and innocent children , is the impression that this die. deservesI also think normal it's this way, , but I believe that the government don't can do what we are not the same thing. thesemany , more than arguments against the death penalty punishment, for me , but I am three are enough for these reasons , harrowing punishment.
