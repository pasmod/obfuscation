 Evaluation English , my English !So nowadays I 'm supposed to wright about my skills in English .One thing I can say is that I wish I was well .It 's not that I 'm terrible at it , but sometimes I precisely ca n't find the right words .I want to be able to use English precisely as easy as I use Swedish .I think it depends on how much I use it , how much practice I get .When I was 17 , I went to Hastings in England for four weeks of English studies , and my English has never been good than when I came home to Sweden again .Me and a friend stayed with mr and mrs Lewis and their child Sarah , and mrs Lewis talked uninterruptedly from the moment we arrived .She asked all sorts of questions about everything , but I think that was a good thing , because otherwise I might have been too afraid to speek at all .After a week I was n't afraid to speak at all and when it was time to go home , it felt like I was born English .Anyway , that was a retentive time ago and I have n't been speaking much English since then .This means that I must have it all somewhere in my head .It 's precisely that I do n't know where .Hopefully I will find at least some of it during this semester .Listening This is something I find quite comfortable .English is n't at all difficult to understand , unless the one who 's speaking is from Scotland or something .It makes n't matter if there 's one or two words I do n't understant , because I usually understand the rest of it .I hear English everywhere around me .I learn it in music , on the television and when I go to the movies .I also like listening to recorded books and the ones in Swedish are actually boring , so I go for the English ones .I think that is good practice .It 's nice to have lectures in English and find that I actually understand everything the teacher is saying .Reading y skills in reading are credibly the same as in listening .In short I can say that I understand most of what i understand .I really like books and if they are written by an English or an American author , I prefer to take them in the original language .Once in a while a word that I do n't recognice pops up , and sometimes I look it up .But if I understand the context , than I almost constantly understand the word without having to look it up .I find reading and listening easyer than speaking and writing , and I think that 's because I can take my time and think , and I do n't have to be afraid to do something wrong .Nobody will care if there 's a word or two that I do n't understand in a text or during a lecture , but if I say or wright something incorrect , everybody will notice it .Speaking The reason I find it unmanageable to speak English , especially if the one I 'm speaking to is from an English speaking country , is that I 'm afraid to say something wrong that will make me look stupid .I have a cousin in Ireland and he told me once that he had almost no English at all in school , and that my English probably was better than his so I guess I do n't experience that much to worry about , but sometimes it 's so hard to find the right words .If I speak som someone out in a pub or in one of the nations , and if I 've had a beer or two , than my English is great , but in the classroom , I just sound stupid .That 's something I do n't like at all , and I hope all the speaking in school will help me with this .Writing Now this is the tricky character .I ca n't remember half of what I learned about Swedish grammar , so how am I supposed to know about transitive verbs , complements and subordinate clauses ?It 's thus easy to wright in Swedish , but when I do it in English I have to think about everything .I can think of something I actually want to wright , and then i have to wright it in some other way because I do n't know how to formulate it .This is actually very frustrating .I guess practice is the medicine for this besides .Finally I really like English and want to learn how to use it , without having to think and worry about everything I suppose .I think it would be an exaggeration to say that my English is bad , but it could be a lot better , and I hope this semester of English studies will help me on the way .
