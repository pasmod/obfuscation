No -- of course I ai n't .Well , I 'll tell you .I 'm a governess , see ?I take care of kids for people and teach them things .A governess , is it ?You must be smart , surely .But let 's not talk about me .Tell me about the wreck , like you promised me you would .'Twas this way , Miss .Two weeks out we ran into the divil 's own storm , and she sprang wan hell of a leak up for'ard .The skipper was hoping to make Boston before another blow would finish her , but ten days back we met up with another storm the like of the first , entirely worse .Four days we were in it with green seas raking over her from bow to stern .That was a terrible time , God help us .And if 't was n't for me and my great strength , I 'm telling you -- and it 's God 's truth -- there 'd been mutiny itself in the stokehole .'Twas me held them to it , with a kick to wan and a clout to another , and they not caring a damn for the engineers any more , but fearing a clout of my correct arm more than they 'd fear the sea itself .You did some hard work , made n't you ?I did that !I 'm a divil for sticking it away when them that 's weak give up .But a lot good it did anyone !'T was a mad , fightin ' scramble in the last seconds with each man for himself .I disremember how it come about , but there was the four of us in wan boat and when we were raised high on a great wave I took a look about and divil a sight there was of ship or men on top of the sea .Then all the others were drowned ?BURKE -- They were , surely .What a terrible end !A terrible end for the like of them swabs does live on land , maybe .But for the like of us does exist roaming the seas , a good end , I 'm telling you -- quick and clane .Yes , clean .That 's yust the word for -- all of it -- the way it makes me feel .The sea , you mean ?I 'm thinking you have a piece of it in your blood , too .Your Old Man was n't entirely a barge rat -- begging your pardon -- all his life , by the cut of him .No , he was bo'sun on sailing ships for years .And all the men on both sides of the family have gone to sea as far back as he remembers , he says .All the women get married sailors , too .Did they , nowadays ?They had spirit in them .It 's entirely on the sea you 'd find rale men with guts is fit to wed with fine , high-tempered girls the like of yourself .
