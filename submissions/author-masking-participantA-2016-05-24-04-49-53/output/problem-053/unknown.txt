Words , words , words .What word could possibly describe the hard work of teaching a foreign language better ?I started to learn English as my first foreign language at the age of nine , and at that age the surveys of language basically consisted of learning words .How to spell them , how to pronounce them and how to use them .We also learnt the about basic phrases , like `` My name is ... '' , `` What time is it ? ''and thus on .The teacher was always eager to tell us how important it was to learn lots and lots of words , but , speaking about myself , I know that this was something I did not quite understand until I first visited an English-speaking area .My inaugural visit to England with my family learned me that when going to the supermarket , you can not ask the staff for Swedish grocery-brands , like `` O'boy '' .Another thing that also turned out to be almost always impossible was to use the Swedish word for a vegetable , for example , but pronouncing the word in an English manner .thus , at the age of ten I realised that words really were just as important as the teacher had told me at school .The phrases I had learnt was not actually useful at that moment since I did not always understand the answers to the questions .After all the word practice , the English-classes tended to be some kind of concentrated word and translating sentences class .At the `` gymnasiet '' , we had lots of grammar lessons , I could not tell you what we were up to all these grammar lessons , but I do remember having them .Every nowadays and then , the teacher tried to make us speak as well , but most of the students ( including myself ) found it a bit ridiculous and artificial to make up a subject just for the aim of trying to discuss it in English .I suppose that it had to do with our age , since I do not find it that ridiculous today .thus , for me it took some time before I actually spoke English , but once started I realised the fun in getting familiar with another extra language .Why entirely have access to one when you can have more than that ?Lately , or the concluding three or four years , I think that my English has developed a great deal .After finishing the `` gymnasiet '' it was as if some kind of psychological barrier loosened up when it came to speak alien languages .With the English but also with the French , it abruptly became a lot easier .When I went to England to visit my sister , who moved there a couple of years ago , I started to converse with her friends rather of just listening , hoping that nobody would start talking to me , mind you , I might would have had to say something .Anyway , the days of only listening to English , have made me good at following conversations , if I am to say something positive about it .I do not know if it has to do with increased simultaneous ability , but today I can not entirely listen to a conversation but also take part in it .Some progress !As progress has been made in speaking and listening , I tend to read more in English as well .possibly because I prefer to read books in their original language , if possible .What is good about taking in English , is the fact that you are exposed to many words , if speaking about that again .But it surely is useful to determine lots of them , as my teacher once said .And you are also exposed to many fresh expressions , which is funny , and good , to know .I can not think of anything more irritating than being in the center of a discussion and then , suddenly someone utters an expression you are not familiar with , or a word .I speak English on a preferably frequent basis since my sister is settled in England but also because my parents have English , or Scottish , neighbours who I see a lot when I am at home .I guess the writing-part is the one I am the least full at , probably because I do not practice that very often .But since my experience of learning languages is , thus far , that `` practice makes perfect '' .I hope that this will apply to learning how to write well in English as well .
