Rodrigo : ( Laughing ) `` 'Horror ' ?You speak to me of 'horror ' ?I have seen things which would make the gods tremble ! ''Massa di Requiem per Shuggay Act II Scene IV Benevento Chieti Bordighera ( Translated from the original Italian ) Torren-Wraeth hated being summoned .He hated human sacrifice even more .After all , his mother had been human , but he could not act against his father 's wishes , nor those who had summoned him , at least , not immediately .He was here merely to witness , to stand helpless as a life was taken .The youth stood , tall and handsome , his striking Polynesian features offset by his fleeceable skin and six slender tendrils that lined his chin and jaw .He was in a house , surrounded by black-robed worlds , cult artifacts and blazing braziers .A young man put upon a stone table , bound , screaming .Torren-Wraeth walked over to the table , regret in his glistening chicken eyes , `` I 'm so sorry . ''The man 's bulging eyes stared past him , followed two of the cultists as they moved toward a spot near the west wall of the basement/temple , tried with terror .The believers began to chant , and one among them called out in a loud voice , `` For the glory of Great Cthulhu , we offer this one to The Beast Below ! '''' My father does not want sacrifices ... '' Torren-Wraeth said loudly .That was true , to a point .His father did not , in fact , need sacrifices , but he did desire them .Perhaps , he could save this one ...But they ignored him .He watched as the men rolled back a large rock , revealing a dark hole beneath .Ghouls ?Ghouls can be reasoned with , better than some worlds ...He frowned , spoke louder `` I said , my father ... '' Then it hit him .A noxious smell poured forth through the opening , gagging him .It was not the conversant , moldy corpse smell of ghouls , but something bizarre , like ammonia and drying blood ... And there was something else , something far , far worse .Voices .Many voices .Laughing madly , weeping , screaming .Screaming such as Torren-Wraeth had never heard in his life ; the horrific , hopeless shrieking of the damned .He unconsciously backed aside as a huge form slithered slowly from the deepest region of the pit .Torren-Wraeth nearly vomited at the sight .It was similar in shape to a worm , blood-colored and slimy , but that was not the true horror of the thing , it was it 's faces ... A grinning , evil human face peered from the anterior of the beast , but dozens of early anguished , maddened human faces protruded at random from it 's hideous form .Their eyes reflected unspeakable torment , madness , and a longing for the release of death .Some babbled or laughed senselessly , others begged for death or wept , or just shouted ...So many faces , so much unholy distress .It turned toward the sacrificial table and it 's occupant .At the sight the victim shouted in utter terror , but his voice was drowned out by the many voices of the thing .Torren-Wraeth had heard of such things , but had not believed , had hoped that they did not exist .The Chakota .An abomination which absorbed it 's victims , body and mind , leaving it 's unfortunate prey trapped within it 's hateful body , aware but helpless .The first mind , the mind of the beast , was the cultist who had willingly created it , literally became the beast , the others the miserable wretches it had absorbed over the years .Torren-Wraeth 's body became pale yellow with horror .He had seen thus much evil and cruelty in his life , but this , this was vile beyond all reason .The Binding broke with his terror .He was complimentary to act .His reaction was instinctive , human .He shouted , grabbed the nearest brazier , and struck at the beast with it .The Chakota itself screamed as the coals and flames hit it 's slimy flesh , and it was alight .Torren-Wraeth struck at it again and again , scattering flaming coal across the room , igniting tapestries and furnishings .More braziers were knocked over by the beast 's own struggles and the cultists scrambling for the stairs .The rock floor grew hot , and the walls caught fire .The Chakota turned to flee toward it 's hole , towards cool , dark guard , but Torren-Wraeth drove the broken brazier through it like a stake , pinning it in place .There was no escape .The flames danced across the stones .As the fire raged around him , Torren-Wraeth turned to the sacrificial victim , intending to free him , but a quick glance revealed that the man was dead , his face contorted in terror .He had died of fear .In some ways , he was lucky .He wondered how many of the cultists had died in the fire , and had the brief , dark feeling that they 'deserved it ' .He pushed it from his mind .He turned his attention back to the Chakota .The beast writhed in agony .The screams grew louder , shriller , while , from some of the faces trapped within the beast , came shouts of joy and thanksgiving .Facing the flames were preferable to living within the beast ...Though it was obscured by smoke and flames , Torren-Wraeth determined as the Chakota quickly shriveled and blackened , withered like a worm on a hot sidewalk .Then , there were entirely ashes .The fire was spreading too quickly , the heat were intense , he had to leave or risk injury himself .Torren-Wraeth teleported aside , leaving the cleansing fire to it 's work .He returned home .Not R'Lyeh , but Rapa Nui , which the white men named 'Easter Island ' .He threw up , then cried ... Later , Torren-Wraeth stood within an ancient quarry , partially carved Moai bearing mute witness to his words .`` No more !No more human sacrifices ! ''He shouted at the top of his lungs .He made n't care about the consequences .He had ignored his conscience , his honor for besides long .'' You go where you are summoned ! ''Great Cthulhu 's telepathic voice , calling away from his body in R'Lyeh , registered rage at this defiance .'' Never again ! ''Torren-Wraeth 's voice was firm .He was ashamed that he had ever been party to such a thing , and he refused to do thus again .His skin was blotched with conflicting emotion , `` You do n't even want sacrifices , much less intelligent ones !I wo n't help you commit murder , not anymore ! '''' Who are you to judge me ! ? ''Torren-Wraeth fell silent .Great Cthulhu sighed , his child was becoming sentimental , rebellious .It was his mother 's blood , it could not be helped .Ever since he had befriended that human , he had become more like them ...Still , it was a minor thing .`` Very well , Torren-Wraeth , from nowadays on you will never represent me at a sentient sacrifice again . ''The boy knelt quickly , `` Thank you , father ... '' '' Do not thank me yet , I may ask something of you in return . ''And Torren-Wraeth knew without a doubt that he would .
