You mutt , you !I 've stood enough from you .make n't you dare .beloved 'em !Oh , my Gawd !You damn thick-head !beloved 'em ?I hated 'em , I tell you !Hated 'em , hated 'em , hated 'em !And may Gawd strike me dead this minute and my mother , too , if she were alive , if I ai n't telling you the honest truth !If I could entirely be believing you now !Oh , what 's the use ?What 's the use of me speaking ?What 's the use of anything ?Oh , Mat , you must n't remember that for a second !You must n't !Think all the early bad about me you want to , and I wo n't kick , 'cause you 've a right to .But do n't remember that !I could n't hold it !It 'd be yust too much to know you were going away where I 'd never see you again -- thinking that about me !If I was believing -- that you 'd never had love for any early man in the world but me -- I could be forgetting the rest , maybe .Mat !If 't is truth you 're after telling , I 'd have a right , maybe , to believe you 'd changed -- and that I 'd changed you myself 'til the thing you 'd been all your life would n't be you any more at all .Oh , Mat !That 's what I been trying to tell you all along !For I 've a power of strength in me to lead men the way I want , and women , too , maybe , and I 'm thinking I 'd change you to a new woman entirely , so I 'd never know , or you either , what kind of woman you 'd existed in the past at all .Yes , you could , Mat !I know you could !And I 'm thinking 't was n't your fault , maybe , but having that old ape for a father that left you to grow up alone , made you what you were .And if I could be believing 't is entirely me you -- You got to believe it .Mat !What can I do ?I'll do anything , anything you want to prove I 'm not lying !Would you be willing to swear an oath , now -- a terrible , fearful oath would send your soul to the divils in hell if you were lying ?Sure , I 'll swear , Mat -- on anything !Will you swear on this ?Yes .Sure I will .Give it to me .'Tis a cross were given me by my mother , God rest her soul .I was a lad entirely , and she told me to keep it by me if I 'd be waking or sleeping and never lose it , and it 'd bring me luck .She died soon after .But I'm after keeping it with me from that day to this , and I 'm telling you there 's great power in it , and 't is great bad luck it 's saved me from and me roaming the seas , and I having it tied round my neck when my last ship sunk , and it bringing me safe to land when the others went to their death .And I 'm warning you nowadays , if you 'd swear an oath on this , 't is my old woman herself will be looking down from Hivin above , and praying Almighty God and the Saints to put a great curse on you if she 'd hear you swearing a lie !
