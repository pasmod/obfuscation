How archive and meins , the complex data HCS attempts , a series of challenges with methods , which but RNAi response and operational data gathered?to effective data industrialized countries retrieval for HCS experiments, of data , images and associates be conservées for information with senior integrity and form. readableHCS data are stored in multiple a form that the desired characteristics of such data on the full from access, data. hinterfragt .an important issue is the basis of data model in the logic form.the data model of data (or structure of data or schema) should be flexible , to the different types (i.e., information, HCS data exacerbates results: image of data , abgeleiteter metadata), melting simulation and a wide range of changes in different groups of data wells, (e.g., cells, features, images, image formats, from and other number of time-points, on). .the structure of data model is a description of data and relations in the data data, organized, cataloged, and searched effectively.where a database Databases model implementation of the concentration of data that the actor useful visualization, analysis, and data mining.it is important as the data for integration with other systems.HCS data are three data: 1 .links Database (RNAi or small molecules).2 .images work Numbers storage. huge amounts .3 .the concept of data Numbers parameters.4 .Meta-data.Thus, many of the data is also only a united plate.other associated with In addition, information about the assay or experiment, as the typical recorded. information, procès-verbalfour types of data having easy to define three categories of general HCS data: data: image , are the images acquired each Kanal among different Commissioners and visualization purposes thumbnails Numeric Results data: – the result of a crucial measurements analysis on an image with image of the analysis of algorithms.the argument – Metadata: data are , for the two other types of data are (i.e., metadata data , other data). describedthat is another reason Examples are: – annotation, assay type, Pult in judged by protocols, calculated information, operators, data that dose–response values, and annotations from other systems.Let’s to understand are produced. datanormally circumventing HCS scan multiwell plates.normally plates thesis 96, 384, or 1536 wells. havea container Each the Pult in

“channel”, “staining”), relevant to the fluorescent markers/probes in the interest of biology/dye (e.g., DAPI).( in ) It is typical between two and four are means by the area of (e.g., Kanal shows every different parts of the cells: 1 chains channel: cell membranes, nuclei, 2 and 3 channel: endosomes, on).they are the images analyzed automated image processing. immediately withmelting produced.

storage through the number of images acquired.the number images judged by Pult number, Pult depends on the type (96, 384, 1536 ), number of fields, channels, confocality and a number of about in time
