It 's wonder you would not stop that machine grinding itself to bits Mr. Murray, and i was hoping the dark thing would bust, and it keeps you from talking to me, this 's true music, yet it is easy to see you have got Irish inside you. Do you know what myself think, and myself thinks you are a natural born kinder, yet all newspaper reporter 're like that I have heard, you wrong me terribly, yet also it 's not charitable to remind me inside my job, myself hoped to forget all about it up here. As I have noted, myself think this exist great to exist able to write; i wish myself could, as you ought to be proud in it, and myself 'm n't, and you ca n't call it writing-- not what I did-- small city stuff; but myself wanted to ask you something. Do you knowing when I 'm to exist moved away to the huts, and in a few days I guess, do n't be impatient; as what 's matter, as do n't you love america here at Sanatorium, as oh-- you-- yes; and i do not care for atmosphere though. All those people up up up out there on the porch seem so ill; it 's depressing; myself ca not do anything for them-- and-- it 's driving me feel so helpless; well it 's rules you know. All patients have to come here first until Doctor Stanton finds out whether they 're well this 's sufficient to exist sent out to huts also cottages; and also remember you are a patient just like ones up up up out there-- even of you 're up and about. Thirdly, myself know it; and but I do not feel as myself were-- really sick love them; none in them do either, yet yes myself guess that 's that pipe dream that keeps us all going eh, well you ought to exist grateful; you are very lucky assuming that you knew it. As an illustration, Shall myself tell you a secret; and i 've seen your chart also _you have_ no cause to worry; and doctor Stanton joked about it; and he said you were too uninteresting-- there was so little the matter with you.
