The Judas Mark`` Cthulhu ftaghn'' He said with laugh swaying his tilted head to right in a drunken manner.`` Cthulhu ftaghn.'' he broke out into a laughing fit; then equally soon as it started it stopped like lightning bolt outside his window. graham was his place in work; and as patient his work was hard to completed, not like he wanted to do it neither, the rain stopped.`` I hear youuuuuuu.'' he chuckled.`` I hear you flapping those blasted wings outside my window.'' he giggler then sobered up.`` Damn go. of CA not Have MY Brain!'' there came a drum in plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to orderly with plastic flashlight, and aforementioned light shining into his padded room.`` Keep it down in there!'' orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.`` Power outrage eh?'' Nevertheless, He chuckled.`` Wonder whyyyy.'' In any case, he rolled his head back to his right towards his window; and his eyes registered sound of earthly wings twitching like insects contemplation flight, oh how he hated those damn things; as far worse than those Shoggoths he faced while back. After, At minus Shoggoths ate you thus ending your torment, and but a Migo…He shuttered, he make not want to think about it.`` Nyarlahotep…You son in bitch.'' Finally, he said looking grumpy then broke out in hysterical then going back as if it never happened. If it were not for you…I 'd be…I would be…'' Where would he be; in his mind he saw himself in diam laying on the beach with Lucinda their two kiss playing in sand as the waves crashed soothingly onto shore. But then his logic would kick that to curb, and lucid was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it were not for that Deep One that is dragging her-kicking and screaming-to bottom in the sea; he would be away from his insane parents. That insane city in munich, even if Lucinda did not accompany him he would at least be free from here, and but then he met him.`` Jesus…''`` Yes?'' came a sweet velvety voice; voice one would hear from royalty.`` Not you.'' he snapped.`` But I am him.'' A hand placed itself on his shoulder as the whole figure appeared sitting beside him like they were best friends.`` No... You are goddamn antichrist; and''`` Is there really a difference in that either?'' jesus asked smile grating his regal black lips.`` Both promise paradise. From there it 's on person 's opinion on what that is.'' he chuckled.`` also do n't say me that you forgot your title Ivan…Or should I say'Judas ', and''`` Then WHY Place ME Here?'' ivan shouted.`` Hey!'' orderly shouted banging his flashlight on the bars again. What did I just say?'' the orderly 's face began to bubble, and his flesh boiled broken screams erupted from his face, and he collapsed and scratched at his expression letting more and more blood poor onto the floor.`` I hate interruption.'' jesus said.`` And as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all potent than he claimed why did he allow Judas to stay in fold; why did he allow lowly wretches hope, why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry laws before she could drown?'' He smiled evil as he described Lucinda 's gruesome devise, ivan panted heavily his rage rising faster than R'lyeh ever would to the surface; ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity whom was already standing laughing at the mortal. Because there 's more to it Judas.'' jesus said.`` Judas of former was an important player of globe, yet the wretches were a growing populace if they loved him they would worship him; yet''`` Bullshit!'' he spat.`` Is it, as''`` We want you to betray us Judas.'' Jesus said after his question was ignored.`` Why; and''`` Sorry but america christ keep some secrets from their disciples; and''`` What makes you Jesus;''`` Our roles.'' he stated simply.`` You see…He was supposed to preach about us, and but sadly his mind could not take it; so Cthulhu became god. Not like it matters religion amendments all the time.'' he smiled all knowing.`` also no he was not son of Cthulhu, and that was my little trick; and''`` Pray Judas'' He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black decaying lips mere inches from his ear. He likes that, it makes him feel powerful; and''`` No'' Ivan said.`` I shall not a damned bastard; and I wo not bring about their reawakening, yet these cries will remain seated!'' jesus laughed.`` That is my due.'' jesus grabbed Ivan by the neck also slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside the window grew from silent drone into frenzy; yet jesus smiled evil drawing his face closer to his Judas.`` In blood the mark is drawn.'' nyarlahotep drew the blade he be hiding and slashed Ivan 's wrist spluttering drops in blood on wall. He watched in delight as the drops spread several linking up also continuing their intricate design; and it consisted in crude circle with entertaining tentacles and a pair in piercing eyes.`` There'' He said.`` Done.'' he tossed Ivan. He landed next to window and as he peered out in it he clearly saw glowing heads also beating miles de go their forms slightly covered by the rain that began to fall again.`` Enjoy your voyage Judas.'' nyarlahotep said. For although I am done with you you 're still serve a purpose.'' mio swarmed window scattering like paper; and ivan barely had it 's time to scream as they were working on his skull amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.`` Cthulhu stage indeed.''
