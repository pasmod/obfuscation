 Entertainment Television- Good or Bad!?! Television is now a part inside everyone 's daily life. It has existed for more than fifty years also most inside us can not imagine life, without it. But still role TV plays in society be being wildly discussed,. Especially its function; as an entertainer. In that essay myself am going tto reflect upon TV entertainment, what 's good thing. Improper; about it also what part it plays inside our lives. People watch lots of TV just to be entertained. There are soap operas, talk shows, comedy series, docu-soaps, game shows. Movies. TV can take you tto different times also places you otherwise only can reach in your imagination or it can just make you laugh. But that sort oof entertainment is not considered tto be a good way, to amuse yourself. That be notably the case when it comes tto junk-entertainment, as soap operas,. Speak shows. Society condemns people who watch these programs, although a huge percentage in population in industrialized countries do watch them. Even though you are being entertained, entertainment TV is perceived as a waste inside time. Obviously, But who can decide what 's a waste for every individual;. How many watching that 's too muchTherefore, ?!Therefore, ? Of course it 's not good for your health tto a narrative song with a recurrent refrain in front inside the TV all day long long, but besides the health factor I personally it be, up tto every single person to deciding how much TV-watching that be too much. There are persons who get addicted tto soap operas. Sure then it has gone out of parting, then it be not entertainment anymore then it 's a must,; but this does not make soap operas a bad thing, in general. Important thing be in my notice that you feel comfortable along your watching. Entertainment is never a waste; entertainment makes life worth living. No one knows why we are living on that land but entertainment surely makes life more fun. But although entertainment TV be amusing there are unfortunately a few negative aspects in it. Soap operas are filled along beautiful people who live glamorous lives, inside music videos looks are nowadays nearly as important, as music, also beauty pageants like`` Miss Universe'' make little girls think that you have to be at least One, Seventy Five meters tall tto be beautiful. Although entertainment TV does not exactly reduce the fixation on looks, it be not its fault this we have that notice on the human being. Beauty 's what people wan na see also this 's what they get. Entertainment TV reflects over here our culture. Also although television be n't accepted as`` culture'' in same manner as theater or literature, inside course it today be a part inside our culture. The TV has given place in our homes also those which do not have one are actually perceived, as a small piece or quantity of something peculiar. Fact is that it is difficult, to follow public discussion. Acting inside society today; without any knowledge of what be on TV at present. Many programs have even become traditions. A good example in Sweden 's the animated show`` Kalle Ankas Jul''; on Christmas Eve. Besides, For many Swedes this show 're nearly as important, as Christmas presents. That is, TV programs can sometimes also be even the majority important to the viewers than that; many long-running TV series have for example own fan clubs. Sample such a series is drama series`` The Prisoner'', which is about lives in women prisoners at Australian prison. However myself think scope inside TV be changing inside new world in computers also others advanced technology. Children play computer game or surf on the Internet instead in watching TV,. A lot inside public information this TV provides can today be found on Internet. You can for example watch the participants in docu-soaps, as, for instant`` Baren'', telecast by Swedish channel TV3, throughout twenty-four hours. Myself think this TV will, for a long time. play an important parting as entertainer, but this it will develop oof other directions than. docu-soaps be example of this. Our own selves can just wait. See what TV. Its entertainment section will have tto offer of the future, also see or watch myself think is only what the entire world will.
