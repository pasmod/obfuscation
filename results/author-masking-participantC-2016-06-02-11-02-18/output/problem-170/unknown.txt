I state what be matter, and you were crying when myself spoke to you, and oh; nothing; and beautiful evening-that 's everything; cheer in the air; and cheer inside air; as you are not lonely just like me, and myself say how 'd you how 'd you get into this? Is n't it awfully hopeless sort inside living; eyes it eyes; and you had been hurt, and just out in hospital to-day, yet the awful war-- all the misery is because inside the war; when will it end; myself say what nationality are you; as rooshian, really! I never met a Russian daughter; and myself say is it as improper as they make out, yet not when I had anyone as ni-ice as you I never had had though; you stopped ' cause I was sad others stop ' cause I am gay. I am not fond in men at everything; as when you know-- be you not fond inside them; as well you barely know them at their best do you; and you will see ' em inside the trenches; and by George, and they are simply splendid-- officers also men every blessed soul. There 's never been anything like it-- only one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice it 's perfectly amazing; and myself expect you be not last at this; you see inside them what you had inside yourself I 're thinking, and oh not bit you be quite out! myself assure you when our own serves made attack where I got wounded there was not single man inside my regiment who was not an absolute hero, as way they went inside-- never thinking of themselves-- it was simply lipping, it 's the same too perhaps along-- enemy. Oh yes, yet i know this; as ah; yet you be not mean due, yet how myself hate mean men; oh; and they 're not mean really-- they simply do not understand, oh; yet you are a babe-- good babe be not you; and but I li-ke you for it. It is so good to find a ni-ice man; and about being lonely; and have not you any Russian friends, and rooshian; no; as city be so been, and were you at the concert before you talked to me, yet yes, myself too; yet i life music; i suppose all Russians do. myself go there always when myself had the money, and what, are you as badly on rocks as this?
