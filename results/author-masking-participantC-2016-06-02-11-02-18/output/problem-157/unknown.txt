Who 'll it be, and ah it 's Fred nicholas perhaps; and eleven 's young due Doctor that she 's busy engaged to get married as you might say; as h'mm-- yes-- she spoke of him. I had a mind to telephone during your the house but myself was n't wistful to bother you known ' you had be coming ' to appeal to-night, as it 's nothing serious myself hope; as ah who can say; here 's the do; yet you have not met he, i have not had the pleasure. of course I have heard---- It 's Doctor mayor, this is Fred nicholas Doctor; sit down Fred that is good lad also be talking ' to Doctor a moment while I go upstairs also see how 's spleen, yet she 's all alone up there, certainly Mr. harmony. Go ahead-- and tell him this how myself 'm sorry myself am to learn she 's gone under weather; and i will so, and do you happen to be any relative to Albert nicholas who 's superintendent over at the towns Manufacturing Company; and he 's classification inside a near relative-- my father; ah yes? myself work for towns Company myself-- bookkeeper---- Miss harmony-- the sick girl upstairs-- she have a position there also did not she before her mon died; yes, and she had job as stenographic for a time. When she graduated from business college course-- I was already working at the towns-- and through my daddy 's influence-- you understand; she was getting on finely too and liked the work. Vis a vis, It 's too bad-- her mother is death myself mean-- forcing her to give it also to follow instructions come home to take care in those kiss; and it 's damn shame; and that 's the primary cause in her breakdown; and myself have noticed she 's been looking badly lately. So that 's trouble, well it 's all his daddy 's fault-- also her own too because whenever myself raised a kick about his making a slave of her she always defended him; and between us harmony 's equally selfish as they make 'em of you want my opinion.
