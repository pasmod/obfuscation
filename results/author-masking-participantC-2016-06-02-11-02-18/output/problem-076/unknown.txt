When I was given assignment to write essay,; inside which I 'm asked tto assess my strengths,. Weaknesses in English language, it did leave me pondering over the matter great deal. Myself have n't thought, about my skills of English, for many years old also now myself realize why. It 's simply myself have not practised them this 's enough since I graduated, from school which, myself might as well add, I did 10 years ago. I had at that point spent an more year in the United States, as exchange pupil. Returning tto Sweden following my the state of inactivity following an interruption there I was more confident than ever about my English skills being. also; for a few unexplanatory reason myself have kept this trust throughout years. Going return tto school, tto study English here inside Uppsala, has however brought me rather abruptly return tto ground earth, asumming that not deeper. This 1st week; at school has been 1st confrontation along English, for a very long time,. I have attained conclusion that I do have forgotten very much. It 's shame this I 've hardly spoken or written anything inside English, for such a long time,. That myself have always expected my English skills to be good. Of course I have been; abroad couple oof times which has given me the opportunitiy tto have conversations inside English, but short conversation inside languages once or twice year 's not enough. Habit this I do have kept, throughout years 's habit, of reading. I have always reading batch, mostly inside Swedish, but often books in English as well. Even though myself usually tend to read`` best-sellers'', not very heavy literature. I consider myself a fairly good reader. It depends, on interests, in a queue or route along which something travels or moves, as it takes me much longer to finish workbook I 'm not interested inside compared to one inside which I am. Even`` best-sellers'' contain; a great many words myself 'm not able tto translate, into Swedish,. Compared to, I often have tto listen them up in dictionary. After, More often,. myself do not listen them up, as you understand meaning inside the framework of the text. I consider my skills in listening to spoken language as good as, inside written one. As long as speaker has got an accent tto which I 'm familiar, I have got no trouble what so ever tto follow. Myself 've noticed,. that I do have harder it 's time to underst. a British accent than American one. That becomes quite clear to me particularly when I 'm watching TV. Considering fact that I have been exposed to American accent daily for per year oof my young people,. Additionally watch American Shows on TV of much greater extent; than I watch British ones, it does make sense tto me. Accents 's Talking, myself would like tto cover my speaking 's skills, inside the my 's meaning own capacity tto talk English. I remember back from US with fluency in spoken English myself would never had before. I went proudly back tto school, as I still had further year tto attand before graduation, being proud of my improvement in English. The, on the other parting, made it very clear tto me that she did not approve, of my American accent. British accent and spelling were all what she accepted,. Was therfore on my back all the times. I was very unhappy about this, I still am, ' cause it mixed everything up in; a some way. Following this, I 'm still, at that day, confused inside matter. I 've noticed, particularly when myself speak, this I pronounce words different all time. Myself try so hard to get British accent, but myself always end up speaking along, a Swedish-British-American pronounciation which myself 'm not pleased along. Pronounciation, and fluency in will be trained daily, 'tween other things, at University, also I look forward, to recieve this training. I have realized that I necessity it... .. Sitting here, the essay on the computer, makes that very moment hitorical one. Inside what fact, you as a reader might ask. That be actually 1st time ever I have written anything inside English on the computer. Myself was introduced tto IT rather late inside my life,. Did not obtain hang, in it couple, inside months ago. In brief, It 's not computer alone I finding a a small piece or quantity of something awkward, it 's in addition the fact this I have n't written anything oof English, especially not essay, for many, many years. I honestly do not recall the last time I wrote.... anything. But once you get started it 's not easy; requiring great physical or mental effort to accomplish or comprehend or endure tto stop as myself do not mind at all. Inside fact myself like it very much,. I 'm positive something like this my skills,. The other skills, will be enhanced all; along this term. A few things myself have forgotten will come back, to me,. Others things myself will learn. There be no doubt, about it. Or, at least myself would not like to so.
