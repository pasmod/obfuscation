Again, ﻿At age in Twenty, myself now look back; at my English studies. It appears unreal this 10 years have gone by since I was in the Fourth grade, which was my 1st year; inside English. Myself can still remember how our own selves sang`` John Brown''. Practiced colours, by book. Everybody also had, to choose a name from English speaking countries. Most oof my classmates had a name from American soap opera`` Dallas'', aforesaid as Pamela, Bobby,. Jenna. Myself was called Patricia,, a name, which my mom came up; along. These 're my 1st memories from studying English. In elementary school, English was more game than, a topic. I have a great affection or liking for it. Inside middle school I started with German also I felt this my English was neglected, which worried me. German was hard but very logic also myself knew,. Understood grammar. Myself could express in words German prepositions, in my sleeping, whereas myself did not know anything about English prepositions. After middle school I have a begining, in a temporal, spatial, or evaluative sense tto dream inside school year abroad. Myself made my decision as I started high school, not just becuase I was worried, about my English skills, but also I longed for adventure. Thanks to my folks that dream became true in One thous. Nine hundred Ninety Six. After my second year oof high school I left for Indiana, U.s.a. My question for that paper is: what have myself learned all, along those − ten years of studying English!?! Which are my strengths. Weaknesses inside four skills oof listening, reading, speaking, also!?! As a result in my school year inside U.s. my ears have become highly familiar along sound, in English language at an everyday level, particularly American English. My time abroad forced me tto listen. Balance attention tto what people said. Since everything was oof English I learned just by inhabit or live in; be an inhabitant of here. I do not 've come into the of something concrete or abstract a problem understanding spoken English at an everyday level, but I 'm very bearing in mind; attentive to oof the the quality of being unalike or dissimilar oof levels. Myself know that myself always have a long road to go. When it comes to reading 's school oof Sweden spent quite a few time on that, at least, at the high school level. Studying oof the U.s.a. Myself also had to do much; of reading, which myself sometimes found difficult, especially, in classes aforesaid, as government. Economics, since there were so many terms this I was not familiar along. Myself do fine reading novels also I have learned to use background when there are words that myself do not know. I enjoy reading novels oof English, but I find it more difficult tto understand shorter the words of something written. Perhaps I necessity more information; to get it. A time limits stresses me also myself tend, to read too fast; this is probably why myself 've got problem along short stories,;. I never did; as good as I wanted, to, on reading. Comprehension testing of high school. Due tto my time in the U.s.a. along the Americans my spoken English developed tremendously. Myself did not realize how much my school English had changed my sisters came tto see me; I had then been in the U.s.a. for one semester. Listening, to English I understood that my English had been given American touch. I learned tto using new words. Speak though I was not sure this it was correct in opinion or. I came tto the point where I allowed me personaly to make mistakes;. I consent to, give permission people laugh at me. Sometimes my language come into the of something concrete or abstract twisted also myself said the craziest alia, yet my mistakes taught me more than myself would ever have learned if I had been quiet. Speaking English sometimes 's driving me nervous,. Oof a strange way myself feel more relaxed speaking English along, or of front oof, English native speakers than I do with my countrymen. be the skill inside which myself have not had very much practice, n't even in the U.s.a. since the tests were still composed oof matching or multiple election questions. My third, and last, year in high school in Sweden I took called`` English C'' also there we actually practiced. Our own selves wrote formal letters, personal notes, a thin triangular flap of a heart valve,. Book reviews. Myself get a lot; in practice by my own since I have so many friends in U.s.a. tto whom I frequently write letters also e-mail messages. A big problem this myself have when myself write be this myself neither feel comfortable along my spelling, neither my grammar. Inside other words: myself need more exercises. Myself want tto point out that myself have learned much, during these ten years but still ten years be a long time also myself feel this I could have learned more than I did. My year inside the U.s.a. has given my English an American touch also it also gave me the will, to study English inside college. Myself can look, read, speak, also write English at everyday level. Myself can survive and live normal the condition of living or the state of being alive inside English speaking countries. Myself want more this this;. I know this coast is long!!
