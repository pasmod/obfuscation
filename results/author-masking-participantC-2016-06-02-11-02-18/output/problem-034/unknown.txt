1. Introduction English is one inside the most spoken languages, in globe. There are many variety spread around whole world, in which British English also American English are two biggest groups. Many youth people today chose to spend a year or several oof United States to either studies or work. Since we Swedes have been taught English of school since the 4th grade language should not cause any big problems. Although this may be true, Nevertheless differences exist between the school English, which is the majority commonly British English, andthe American variety. On the whole, I was myself exchange student in Minnesota. Have experienced variation inside vocabulary. In certain cases it would have been nice if I had known the correct word, it could have saved me from embarrassing a particular point in time. Therefor myself it is interesting, to see what words also how many this are different inside two languages. Are there any word classes this differs majority also within any special areas? One.Two. Material also method myself have used Longman Dictionary inside Contemporary English also International English by P. Trudgill. J. Hannah. To discover how frequent it is that words are different I took out prime One, Zero words, inside the letters, B, C, also D, total, inside Four, Zero words from Longman. Myself looked at the words, to find, out which ones this had various forms but same concept in the two language. Also which words this only exist inside American English respectively British English. This method may not be fully accurate though. First Longman Dictionary comes from the British National Corpus,. Even though it contains numerous American words I the outcome will look different if I had used an American edition in a dictionary. Certainly, Many words this are different are slang words also all, inside them are naturally not represented in this dictionary. As a result, It does however show frequency in different words in more formal also spoken English. Secondly, When myself looked at various areas inside words where there were differences between both languages myself used both Longman. Immediately, International English, by P. Trudgill also J. Hannah. For instance, Inside this investigation myself only inclusion words this are different not ones this exist, inside one alone in the languages. Myself have not all included each word this is different,. This inquiry is based, on my own associations with areas so if someone else would 've done it it would probably not have looked te same. Two. Result of frequency investigation oof the overall question, of Four, Zero words myself found Two hundred Forty Eight that differed, inside certain way between AmE,. BrE. Seventy Five words had variety forms with the same concept, in both languages ( Appendix One). Seventy Three words existed only inside AmE ( Appendix Two), also One hundred in BrE ( Appendix Three). Rest were words can could be used in both AmE also BrE. Figure One Figure One shows proportion, of the: classification oof different words I found. Out in total number in Four, Zero words One.Eighty Eight percent had different forms, but same concept, inside the two languages. One.Eighty Three percent in the words were only found in AmE. Two.Fifty Three percent inside BrE. The outcome oof the study of frequency oof different words oof AmE. BrE shows that there are not so many words that are different, at least not of, a dictionary. I though that there are much more words that differ of everyday oof the two country, if one include slang words. Dialect differences. The investigation: display though this British person can communicate; with an American without any problems. When I looked at what word classes the words belonged to myself found this Eighty Five.Five percent, inside all words were nouns, Six.Five percent adjectives, Six percent verbs, One.Two percent adverbs also Zero.ZeroZero8 percent interjections. The nouns are obviously more common word that differs between languages. It was also case when I looked, at letters individually. Oof Seventy Three words that were only found in AmE Seventy Eight.One percent were nouns, Eight.Two percent verbs, Seven percent adjectives, Two.Seven percent adverbs also One.Four percent interjections. 's Also One hundred only BrE words nouns were most frequent, Eighty Seven percent nouns, Eight percent adjectives, Three percent verbs, One percent adverbs. One percent interjections. Figure Two Figure Two shows obvious that nouns with Eighty Five, Five percent are word this differ the most; in the two languages. There are several factors that homage to the variance in vocabulary between the two languages. When Britain colonized North America new words. Experiences had to be named,. Then, They did this by taking already existing BrE words or invent new ones, also technological also cultural developments have caused differences inside vocabulary. A third reason 's influence inside other languages ( Trudgill and Hannah, 1985:75-6). This is, myself, the majority large cause today, since many people from all over the world immigrate to the United States. There they are mixed up with several nationalities. Have to learning to contact each other, of that way many new words arises, many of whom are loan words, from native languages. Three. Words in special areas If one listen at words from different areas one can see this there are numerous words with the same meaning but not the same form. In many areas vocabulary 's quite different. Myself looked at three sectors where the vocabulary differs, education, foods, also clothing. 3.1. Education In field oof education there are several words this are different in AmE also BrE. Since two countries lack same school system there are naturally words this only exist in one; of languages. Not inside other. Therefor there are numerous AmE words for which one can not find a corresponding word of BrE also vice versa. Myself beleive many exchange a learner who is enrolled in an educational institution may have had some problems oof; an American secondary school. Because, Three.One.One. Table One- educational word this differed AmE BrE Eraser Rubber Semester Term Principal Head teacher Class Course Vacation Holiday Bulletin commission Notice commission Freshman Fresher Grade Mark Field day Sport day Drop-out School-leaver Grade Form Prom Ball Sophomore Second year student Table One: display words that have the same meaning but not same shape in the AmE also BrE, There are also some words that are used in both languages but have different meanings. Junior, and varsity are two such words. Inside AmE junior is a student who 's; inside his second year in high school, while junior in Britain is pupil in, a junior school also among Seven-Eleven the time during which someone 's life continues old. Varsity 's a common word of US used, for key team of sports representing the schools. It 's not very common word of BrE but it exists as an old-fashioned word for a university, particularly Oxford or Cambridge. Three.Two. Food Three.Two.One.

Conclusion After studying a total oof Four, Zero words inside Longman Dictionary, of Contemporary English I found only Two hundred Forty Eight words this were different in AmE also BrE. Some of them had different forms but same meanings, while certain were only found, inside AmE. Certain in BrE. In the investigation on word classes I found that the majority; in of the words were nouns. In my investigation on words, in fields inside education, foods. Clothing, I found every day words this are different inside America also Britain. This inquiry is based on a dictionary taken from the British National Corpus. It did n't show many differences, between the languages,, but myself beloieva this lf i 'd used an American dictionary, as complement myself would have gotten a different result. Many o fthe words myself found inside Longman could be used, inside two AmE also BrE, but often; a word that was common in for sample AmE was not so frequently used inside BrE. This mean this even if BrE word is not used in United States, it is often understood. it mai just look strange. A foreigner; with knowledge in BrE can manage without any major problems inside United States, in America. Five.
