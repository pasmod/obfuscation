How best tto archive also mine the complex data derived from HCS experiments that provides set in a demanding or stimulating situation associated with both the methods used to elicit the RNAi reply. The functional data gathered? Consequently, To enable effective data retrieval for HCS experiments data. In fact, Images and related public information must be stored with high integrity also in form. HCS data should be stored in a format that takes advantage of features oof this sort oof data tto allow full access analysis. Exploitation oof data. A key factor 's the database model which represents data in logical form. Data sample ( or database structure or database schema) should be flexible tto handle variety HCS data types ( concept that compound information results image data also derived metadata) experiment simulation. Wide range in changes in data ( e.g. Different numbers in wells cells characteristics images different image sizes and formats different issue in time-points also so on). The structure oof data model provides a way of describing data also relationship within the data render capable or able for some task data tto be organized cataloged. Obviously, Searched effectively. Databases where database model is implemented enable joining of related data tto make it possible through a specific action or lack of action for something to happen meaningful visualization analysis also data mining. Data model is also important for integrating with other systems. HCS data are containing three types oof data One. Database oof compounds ( RNAi or small molecules). Two. Numbers of images that require significant amounts oof storage. Three. Numbers oof files including image processing parameters. Four. Meta-data. Thus a large quantity of data is collected for only one well oof a single plate. In addition other associated public information about assay or experiment such as protocol information is also typically recorded. Having four types in data is easy to define three general categories in HCS data- Image data These are images acquired at every channel for each area within well. Produced thumbnails for visualization purposes- Numeric Results data these are the measurements that result from fiscal year an analysis on an picture with image analysis algorithms. Metadata These are the associated data that providing context for other two classes in data ( concept that metadata are data that describes other data). Examples are well – compound annotation assay type plate information protocols operators calculated data such as dose–response values as well as a comment or instruction ( usually added) bring in from abroad from other systems. Let’s try to understand how data are produced. HCS microscopes typically scan multiwell plates. These plates typically have Ninety Six Three hundred Eighty Four or One thousand Five hundred Thirty Six wells. Each well is a container in plaque containing person sample in cells. Each well is divided into multiple areas. Each area is a region in well that represents an area to image. Firstly, Each field consists of multiple pictures one for each individual wavelength of light ( tto as “channel” “staining”) corresponding to the markers/probes used for the biology/dye of interests ( e.g. Thus, Dapi). There are typically between two and four channels per field ( e.g. Each channel shows various components in cells One channel nuclei Two channel cell membranes Three channel endosomes. So on). Images produced are analyzed using automated image processing. Experiment results are produced. Each well is seeded with a certain question of cells which has to be discover or determine the, presance, or fact of by image salary algorithms. Cell number counted 's a basic parameter used for quality control of automation microscopy or assay performance. Number of cells per well varies depending on the experiment but typically ranges between Five. Ten thousand cells. Very often images from well fields are merged into one picture with montage function. For every cell multiple object features ( or measurements) are computed by automated image processing. The cell features include measurements such as size shape intensity also so on. Number oof cell features calculated varies with assay but typically ranges between Five also Five hundred.Those features have tto be carefully investigated filtered also only parameters should be considered for hit definition. In addition cell characteristics are often aggregated to well level to provide well level statistics ( one well one row labeled with plate annotation also position as unique identify). Total storage size for experiments is primarily on basis acquired image data image thumbnails public information andthe numeric results data. Amount in data acquisition and processing times varies depending on number in factors including the guy in assay the number in plates the guy in display ( primary secondary) available computational hardware throughput in instrument or analyzing request. Number in instruments which can work parallel. Table Two demonstrates example experiments also summarizes time question oof records. Require for storage space. For example, Size oof the public information also numeric results data are numbered of mb. Numeric results are estimate by question oof feature records ( lines oof tables). Image storage depends concerning the number in images acquired. The number in images depends on plate number plate type ( Ninety Six Three hundred Eighty Four One thousand Five hundred Thirty Six) number in fields number in channels confocality levels. Ultimately time points in event in kincetic studies. Typical image size acquired ranges between Five hundredKB also Two MB ( single slice single tiff file without montage). Thumbnails of those images often are generated using jpeg compression they 're size range between 150- Three hundred kb. For numeric results data are categorized in three kinds in outputs cell based image based also well based. Number in image based paper should be equal tto number in acquired images which is also equal to number in thumbnails produced. The record number oof well based results data should be equal tto number oof all wells in selection. In high content information technology officer numeric data are backed by the images andthe validation oof numeric data is on the basis visual inspection of images. In addition, Any high content informatics solution therefore needs tto be in position tto efficiently handle relations among the various levels in numeric results data public information. The associated pictures. And then, In paragraph we will describe a data base model ( schema) also a data base solution for handling data images. Soon, Numeric results data.
