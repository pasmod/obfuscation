 Children watch too much violence on television There are too much violence on television. A lot in children are watching it. There 's probably no realy good solution, from 'saving ' children; against violence on television but there are numerous ways, inside keep from happening or arising; make impossible them tto see too much, inside it. There are mostly, a responsibility, for parents but also responsibility for television corporations. First of all children will not watch, as much TV as they do, there 's lots of things that are much best for them tto do instead, things this are more creative. Television be probably not improper for children of surten amount. Asumming that they watch programs this are suitable for them. It has tto be a control oof what they are watching. Parents have to obtain key responsibility, that they know what children are watching also do n't leave them watch everything they want, but there be also liability, for television corporations. Programmes with lots inside violence do not have to be sent early also there could be advisories that warn in excessive violence. This can at least help parents, a bit. When the parents are, at home they can go,. Have look; at what the children are watching. Asumming that parents are at labor also children are not old sufficient to see everything on TV they perhaps will not be left at home without any others being included or involved. There be probably someone they could stay along, a person related by blood or marriage, neighbours or friends with grown man at home. Although this may be true, There are also often too many televisions, in certain homes. To illustrate, A lot, in children have own TV, inside rooms also this makes it harder for parents to know what children are watching. Parents could also speak along children about the programmes, ask them what it used; about. It 's important this children speak about what they 've seen, asumming that they have seen something this they perhaps should not have had parents can speak also explaining what violence be done to people also that everything on television are not for real. One reason why lot oof children watch too many TV be probably becuase parents do not have so lot of time, for them. They should leave them play along friends or make more oof own time for them. Everything 's not as important than tto do things this development inside children. In article in Time Magazine, ( Television: Support grows for the V-ship as way in protecting youth viewers, July Twenty Four, One thous. As I have noted, Nine hundred Ninety Five), one a just detectable amount inside protecting children against violence on television be to have, a TV; along the V chip. This could be help for parents to control what children are watching, or something children are not going to watch. And then, Even if it is not perfect solution it be at least help. One of the problems with V chip, as the section reveals, be that there are problems along technologies, the V chip wont be able to tell a variation that deviates from the standard or norm, between violence oof different kinds. As I have said, Asumming that V chip be going to be an alternative it has to be well thought-out so it be more assistance than problem tto have it. there 's not one good solution for protecting children; against violence parents. Society have to try tto control what children are watching, as extent that it is possible. It has tto be adult people who decide what 's good also what 's bad, for children, to watch also make shore that they do not see too much violence on TV.
