Not for mine; myself 'm full up, yet and you-- Had anything ' to eat recently, and not since that morning on the train; yet then ouh better go easy on it had not ouh; and guess you are right; and myself got to meet someone too. But my nerves be on edge after that rotten trip, as ouh said ouh was just out hospital; and two weeks ago, and the joint myself be of out of St. Paul got raided; as that was beginning; and the judge give all us girls thirty days. The others did n't seem to mind being inside the cooper much, a few inside 'em be used to it, as but me myself could n't stand it, it 've got my goat right-- could not eat or sleep or nothing; as myself never could stand being caged up nowhere. I got good and ill also they had to send me to hospital, and it was nice here, as i was sorry to leave it honest; did ouh say ouh got to meet someone here, and yes; and oh n't what it mean; and it be my Old Man I got to meet; as honest! It 's funny too; i ai n't see it since myself was a kid-- do n't even know what he looks like-- must had a letter every now also then; that was still the sole address he give me to write him back. He 's monitor of certain building here now-- used to be a sailor, and monitor; sure, also I was thinking maybe seeing he ai not never done a thing for me of my life he might be prepared to stake me to chamber also eats till I get rested up. Gee myself inside course necessity this rest, myself 'm knocked out; yet but myself ai not expecting much from him; and give you a kick when you are down that 's what all men do, and men myself hate 'em-- all in 'em! And myself do n't expect he will turn out no better than the rest, say do you hang out around this dump much; oh off also on, then maybe you know him-- my Old Man-- or at least seen him, and it ai not old Chris is it; old Chris? Oh, Chris Christopherson his full name is, and yes that 's him, anna Christopherson-- this 's my real name-- only out there I called me personal Anna christine; so you know him hut, as seen him about for years, and say what be he like tell me honest, and oh he 's short also--
