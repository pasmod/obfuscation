 Evaluation - English , My English !Recently , not a lot more than a month ago actually , a thrombosis was found in my brain .And as if that were not bad enough , the thrombosis had caused several cerebral haemorrhages .Part of the reason to why this was discovered was that I lost my ability to speak and write - I simply did n't know the words , or the letters for that matter , and I could not spell at all .I 'm not completely healed from this yet , but I am a lot , much better .Luckily neither the thrombosis or the haemorrhages has made any lasting harm to my brain , according to the doctors .But because of this it 's kind of hard for me to say how good or bad I am in the different areas of the English language right nowadays .But I know that I 've always loved words and sentences , stories and text , and not merely the English ones .Since I was fourteen , I 've been wanting to move to England .And I know that before this illness of mine I used to think of myself as a pretty good English speaker , when it comes to pronunciation and finding the right words - at least for someone who has never been to England or the US .But most of the time I 'm a bit besides shy to speak as much as I ought to , I think .So , you 'd remember that a person who speaks quite good English also is good at listening , but I 'm not .It 's not that I do n't understand , more like I do n't learn what people are saying .I have bad hearing , I 'm aware of that , but this might be because of something else .I do n't know .One thing I 'm certain has been effected by my thrombosis is my spelling .I 've gone from being a person who makes few mistakes when it comes to spelling to being a person who 's really bad at it .I loose letters and sometimes even whole words .The same thing happens when I read , I precisely do n't know the words in front of me sometimes , not even the most simple ones .And I 'm absolutely certain it was n't this way before I got ill .But enough about my illness !No .I 've never been a good reader , not even when I read swedish text .But still I love books .Unfortunately I do n't seem to be able to find the time to sit down and read .But I do realise I want to do that more often .Do n't get me wrong here .I 'm not what you 'd call a `` bad reader '' .I understand the text perfectly well , perhaps better than some early people , who would consider themselves to be good readers , it 's just that I read very slowly .But I do n't remember that is that much of a problem .So , what have I got left ?Writing of course !I love to write !I 've written three and a half full length books , in swedish though .But I also love to write in English .I have a homepage on the internet and on one of the pages there , called `` stories '' my boyfriend and I write a new shorter story every week .It 's thus much fun and to judge from the comments we 've been getting from our visitors , we 're pretty good at it too .And yes , I agree .I 'd like to think of myself as a good author , at least when it comes to fiction .Essays , like this one , are a bit harder to write , but I have not had that many chances to practice , and nobody has shown me what it should be like .When I said I thought of myself as a good writer I did n't necessarily mean that my grammar is good besides , because it 's not , not always .I just happen to have studied a some swedish grammar , which I try to apply to the English language , and sometimes the two do n't really meet .But in total I guess you could say that I 'm one of these mediocre students who wants to become a teacher in English because of a genuine interest in language rather than high skills .And therefor , I guess , will have to work heavily to pass this education , but who , for the same reason , will find that it 's worth it .
