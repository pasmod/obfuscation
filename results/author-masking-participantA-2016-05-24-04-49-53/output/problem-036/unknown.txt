y foremost actual contact with the English language was in third grade in compulsory school .I remember I was actually looking forward to it .I was going to determine how to speak and read in a foreign language .It felt like it made me turn up a little bit !I do n't remember how many English lessons we had a week at that time but I remember that a teacher came to our small school only for those occasions .I suppose my ordinary teacher was n't certificated for it or just did n't want to teach English .Well , I wished learning some English words and I liked the English lessons for the rest of compulsory school as well .And it was pretty cool to be able to speak some when being abroad , in Greece for example .At senior high school though , I made of some reason lose my interest for English .I found it like everyone in my class was doing much better than me .Many of my friends had been to England or the United States taking language courses during some weeks in the summer .nowadays when looking back at that time I do n't think I actually was much worse than the others , perhaps instead bad self-confidence was the reason why I was n't so active on the English lessons .Of course I did make the exercises in the books , read what we were supposed to read and answer the questions I got .But I did n't throw myself into discussions though , and speeches in front of the class were n't exactly 'my cup of tea ' .One year after senior high school , I got to know about a one semester English class in Portslade near Brighton in Great Britain .It is a course you apply for through Visings Folk High School in Sweden .There are only Swedish students on the path but all teachers and staffs are Englishmen/women .And your accommodation during the course is with an English class .I went there hoping to improve my English and also to become a glimpse of British society and culture .This was accordingly the inaugural time I was really forced to speak English .I was surprised how comfortable it was to get into the language .I surely made lots of grammatically mistakes but that was n't so important at that moment .The independent thing was that I actually dared to speak and put my trust in that people understood me .I think the better way of learning a language , is to stay in a country where that language is spoken , for a while .Of course we studied grammar , wrote essays and so on the path , but I think I learn most just by listening , speaking and constantly being `` surrounded by English '' , written and spoken .Now , when going to study English again ( and this time on a more advanced degree ) , I feel a bit unused to it because I have n't practised it for a while .But I think , or at least hope , it will be quite comfortable to get into it again , at least the listening part .I remember that is the easiest thing , unless the speaker has got some , for me unknown , dialect or anything .When it comes to reading I think it depends very much of what you are reading , whether it is unmanageable or not .When reading an English-written novel , I may not understand exactly all of the words , but I can get the floor on the whole anyway .If reading specialist literature , though , it might be a bit more difficult , due to the fact that there may be lots of words that I normally make n't get into contact with .According to speaking , as I mentioned before , I think it 's a question of self-reliance for me .When I was in England I think I improved my speaking ability a lot , at least to use the language in casual speech .I hope I will get into the language like that again now and also enlarge my vocabulary ( in writing as well , of course ) .What I also would like to develop more is my pronunciation .At this moment I think there is sometimes besides much a mix of Swedish- , American- , and British English in my language .My ambition is to get a consistently British pronunciation and fluency in my speaking .( I think I have a retentive way to get there , though ! )Concerning myself , I think , writing in English is the about difficult part .Maybe not spelling words right , but handling with the grammar right , knowing what expression or word burst where , and getting a clear structure in my composition , are , among other , things that I have to practise more .That 's common for all of the four skills that I 've noted - I have to practise a lot !
