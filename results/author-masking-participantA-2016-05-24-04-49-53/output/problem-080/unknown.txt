 My strengths and weaknesses in the English language Ten days after finishing high school , I am now to study English again .This time on a much eminent level .It is time to evaluate what my strengths and weaknesses are .Listening In general I 'm a full listener .For instance , while listening to a lecturer , I do n't have a problem to focus on what is being said ( unless the person I 'm listening to causes the subject really boring , or when I 'm very tired ) , and I usually understand the lot .My weakness is my minor vocabulary .I think I scored about average on the diagnostic test I took on vocabulary .Since I did a lot of guessing , picking away the right words , it is reasonable to assume that my vocabulary is even below average .I love watching English movies and I pick up on the language just by listening to it when I make the effort not to look at the subtitles .And of course by reading , which is what the adjacent part in this essay is about .Reading I like to take novels for the fun of it , but also other sorts of literature about various kinds of matters .Therefore I believe the literature class and the social studies will be easier for me than other courses .My weakness in this class is , once again , my lack of vocabulary .It slows down my reading a great deal , but the pace will increase the more I understand , as well as my vocabulary .I think I 'm fairly full when it comes to interpreting novels , short stories and poems .My strengths are the fact that I love reading and that I usually understand the content , irony and humour .Speaking y strength when it comes to speaking English is that I 'm not afraid to make mistakes .I 'm here to learn and of course I 'm not perfect from the beginning .furthermore , I believe that my speaking ability will improve rather quickly once I start practising on a daily basis .I find the rhythm of the language and the accent , more unmanageable to learn than the pronunciation is .I am very rusty though , I have n't spoken English since high school , like I said , and then it was almost just about answering questions .The trouble is that there is a limitation to what I can talk about with my present vocabulary , and that I do n't have the right intonation .Writing y writing skills are very unmanageable to evaluate ; I do n't really know what my strengths and weaknesses are .I know that I ca n't be that full at it , since my vocabulary is limited and my knowledge in grammar is bad .I remember that grammar is very tricky , it is probably my number one weakness .I have some advantage though , since I studied Swedish grammar last year .My ability to focus on a subject is fairly full , but it can become better .I 've written a lot in Swedish and maybe that is also an advantage to some extent .I find it rather difficult to write this essay and I imagine it will be even harder when I get an intricate subject to write about .My strength would be my ambition to learn and trying to get it properly .Conlusion To bring this essay to an end , I will nowadays summarise my different strengths and weaknesses in the English language .My lack of vocabulary has a damaging effect on all parts of the language .My difficulty with grammar naturally has a damaging effect when it comes to writing and in some ways speaking .( Needless to say it will give me a lot of study at the grammar course ) .I am not accustomed to speaking English , which of course will make it unmanageable from the beginning .My strengths are my faculty to learn languages and my ambition to do thus .I hope that I will be able to transfer my writing skills in Swedish to my writing in English .My interest in reading will help me through the continuous study increasing my vocabulary , as my general interest in English will help me through all courses .
