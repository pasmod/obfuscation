 When Harriet and David meet they know that they 've found what they 've been looking for .Someone with whom they can make what they 've both been dreaming of and hoping and waiting for all their lives - a big happy family .But when the fifth child comes along things variety and their happiness falls to pieces because Ben is not like them and he does n't fit into their lives .They say he 's unlike .But is he actually different ?And if thus , then what is he different from ?The independent theme of this text is the meeting of two worlds , the normal and the abnormal , the known and the unknown , the civilized and the foreign .These worlds are represented by the family on one side and Ben on the early .By studying the setting of this text we can see how these worlds relate to eachother and to their surroundings .David and Harriet are unlike .That is stated from the very inaugural page in this text .They are two oddballs who find in each early exactly what they have been looking for to spend their future with .They share the like dreams and beliefs .Their definitions of happiness are the like .But it must be sorted out - what makes differet mean in this case ?A contradictive sentence to what I 've precisely stated in the first page is `` They defended a stubbornly held view of themselves which was that they were ordinary ... '' ( p.7 ) .Ordinary .Is n't that the direct opposite of unlike ?We must make clean that different in this case means not like most people in their surroundings while ordinary means old-fashioned .Then comes the fifth child and slowly tears the family aside with his violence , hate and cold , evil eyes .He is unlike too .But from what ?There are several things in the text that show that the world outside this class bliss is changing : `` [ ... ] the greedy and selfish sixties [ ... ] '' .( p.29 ) `` The small town [ ... ] had changed [ ... ] .Brutal incidents and crimes , once shocking everyone , were nowadays commonplace . ''( p.29 ) `` Two peoples existed in England , not one - enemies , hating eachother , who would not hear what the other said . ''( p.30 ) Ben is greedy and selfish .Whenever he speaks it is to say things like `` Give me this '' or `` Ben wants that '' .And he is selfish because the only reason he is controllable to a certain point is Harriets threat to bring him back to the place that scares him .Later on Ben leads to crime and violence , robbery , rape etc .Without defending it in any way I have to say that it is n't uncommon , it makes n't take an alien to do it .The two peoples that populated England can well be represented by Paul , the youngest child who is the one who gets largely effected by Ben 's presence , and Ben .They hated eachother .thus if Ben is part of this world , what he really is different from is Harriet 's and David 's family life .possibly that 's why everyone outside the family fails to recognize what Harriet so badly needs confirmed - that Ben is different .He makes n't fit in to their odd life but maybe he is just a contemporary figure that ends up in an anachronism .Their is another exaple of how David and Harriet are unlike from other people on page 8 .David and Harriet are watching people at the dance enjoying themselves .'' Both had reflected that the faces of the dancers [ ... ] could precisely as well have been distorted in screams and grimaces of pain as in enjoyment '' .They see the world in a different direction .They do not fit in .And they get a child that maybe does fit in to the rest of the world , but not in their lives .Harriet and David are unlike from each other too in some ways and that is also important for how they react to Ben and deal with him .They have for example unlike backgrounds .His parents are divorced while her mother seems to have everything she wants .possibly that explains why David does n't leave , although he thinks his wife has let him down .And Harriet blames herself for Harriet calls Ben an alien and spends hours trying to figure away where he comes from , who are the ones of his own kind .She tries to these two worlds to go in concert but David does n't .They cope with this matter in different ways .Harriet wants to determine what is going on inside Ben 's head , how he sees the world , what he thinks about .She also tries to make Ben more like them .She wants to teach him by making him watch her and Paul play and then play the like game with him .David precisely wants to get rid of him .He accepts the idea that Ben will never be like them .On page 13 it says `` his wife must be like him in this ; that she knew where happiness lay and how to prevent it '' .When Harriet failed him in this matter by going back for Ben she made him very angry and disappointed .But rather of leaving her he burried himself in work which kept him from home all day .Why ?Maybe because he knew that the damage was already made the moment Ben came in to their lives .Leaving him to die in that place would n't have their happiness .
