I will nowadays write an honest essay about my English and how I assess it .First of all , I love to write !I got very happy when I heard that we , the students in this A-level class , are going to write many essays !When I see a piece of blank paper , I immediately desire to fill it with letters .I rarely have any problems with spelling .Once I have taken a word , I usually know how to spell it .I think it 's easier to write than to speak in many situations .When I write , I can check writing for a while and just think about what I want to write further on in the text .When I speak it 's not that easy to stop and think about what I am supposed to say , because then the people I 'm talking to continue to speak , and the very important thing I was thinking of will never be discussed .When I write , I can go back in the text and variety and I can change several times , so it 's very different from speaking .Maybe that is why I love to write , because I can remember in peace and quiet .I think I 've always loved to write , ever since I was a little girl writing in my diary every evening .When I was eleven years erstwhile our class found another class , in Great Britain , and they were about our age and we got penfriends .I think I learnt quite a lot by writing in English to my penfriend for many years , and I however write letters , not to her though .When I studied at Komvux here in Uppsala , our English teacher told us to write an essay every week .It was n't compulsory but I handed in one every week because I 'm thus fond of writing , and I thought that my teacher could evaluate my English by reading my texts .When it comes to speaking I must say that I am a fiddling bit shy of speaking in a quiet classroom with all unfamiliar students surrounding me .In such situations my English does n't sound like I want it to sound .It 's difficult to speak fluently and spontanleously , but I know that I will practice talking in this class .You should visit me at home and spy on me when I 'm doing my homework , because I practically constantly read aloud to myself to get the right pronunciation by reading the phonetics .It 's a habit to read aloud , but I do n't know if it 's a full or a bad habit .Sometimes , when I 'm reading a book in a public place , I think it 's difficult to understand quiet and I have noticed that I move my lips secretly .After writing comes reading , my second favorite in order .Naturally it depends on the text if it is readable or not , but most of the time I accept all kinds of texts .I do have to confess something , and that is that I think it 's hard to understand the paper , the news about politics and wars .I remember that is like listening to the news on the TV or the radio .They use a unlike language from the language they often write in literature .But I am aware of my defect , so at the moment I subscribe to Newsweek where I can take international news about Clinton 's counterattac and the Olympics scandal ( That sounds boring , does n't it ? ) .Reading novels , short stories and magazines are very amusing but I find it tough to read in bed in the evening , because then I usually take the entire book which means I will be very tired the day after .I think it can be difficult to listen to English , but not in all situations though .I do understand the English when I attend a lecture or when I speak with a person , but when I listen to the news on the telly or the radio , I sometimes feel dazed because I do n't receive the information .That is something I actually must practise .
