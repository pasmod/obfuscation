From what he told me , I should say it was the only thing for Eileen to do if she wants to become well quickly .And I 'd certainly not go against Gaynor , if I were you .He told me he 'd make it hot for you if you did .He will , besides , you can bet on that .He 's that kind .He 's a divil .But what can he do -- him and his Sasiety ?I 'm her father .Oh , he 'll do what he says , make n't worry !You 'll make a mistake if you think he 's bluffing .It 'd probably get in all the papers about you refusing .Every one would be down on you .You might even lose your job over it , people would be so sore .Ah , divil lead him !get him send her where he wants , then .I 'll not be sayin ' a word .And , honestly , Mr. Carmody , I don't see how you can object for a second -- after he 's told you it's absolutely necessary for Eileen to run away .( _Seeing_ Carmody 's _shaken condition , he finishes boldly._ ) You 've some feeling for your own daughter , have n't you ?You 'd be a fine father if you had n't !Whisht !She might hear you .But you're correct .Let her do what she 's wishful to , _and_ become well soon .That 's the correct spirit .I knew you 'd see it that way .And you and I'll do all we can to help her .Well , I guess I'll have to go .Tell Eileen -- -- You 're not goin ' ?surely , Eileen is puttin ' on her clothes to come down and have a look at you .She 'll be here in a jiffy .Sit down nowadays , and wait for her .No -- no -- I ca n't stay -- I only came for a moment -- I 've became an appointment -- honestly .Besides , it is n't correct for her to be up .She's besides weak .It 'll make her worse .You should have told her .Good evening , Fred .Hello , Eileen .I 'm so sorry to -- -- You must sit down .You 've got to take care of yourself .You never ought to have got up to-night .
