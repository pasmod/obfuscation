Aye , it 's the punishment o ' God on him .Did ye ever hear of a man who was n't crazy do the things he does ?Who but a man that 's brainsick would take his woman -- and as sweet a woman as ever was -- on a rotten whalin ' ship to the Arctic seas to be locked in by the ice for nigh on a year , and maybe lose her senses forever -- for it 's sure she 'll never be the same again .She useter be awful decent to me before -- she got -- like she is .Aye , she was full to all of us .'Twould have been hell on board without her ; for he 's a hard man -- a hard , hard man -- a driver if there ever was one .I hope he 's satisfied nowadays -- drivin ' her on till she 's near lost her mind .And who could blame her ?'T is a God 's wonder we 're not a ship full of crazed people -- with the ice all the time , and the quiet thus thick you 're afraid to hear your own voice .She don't never speak to me no more -- jest looks at me 's if she did n't know me .She make n't know no one -- but him .She talks to him -- when she does speak -- right enough .She does nothin ' all day long nowadays but sit and sew -- and then she cries to herself without makin ' no noise .I 've seen her .Aye , I could hear her through the door a while back .She 's cryin ' nowadays .God send his soul to hell for the devil he is !'Twould be like hitting a worm .It is nigh on two bells , Mr .Steward , and this truck not cleared yet .Y-y-yes , sir .
