It 's a wonder you would n't stop this machine grinding itself to bits , Mr. Murray .I was hoping the darn thing would bust .It keeps you from speaking to me .That 's the real music .It 's easy to see you 've become Irish in you .Do you know what I think ?I think you 're a natural born kidder .All newspaper reporters are like that , I 've heard .You wrong me terribly .And it isn't charitable to remind me of my job .I hoped to forget all about it up here .I think it 's great to be able to write .I wish I could .You ought to be proud of it .I 'm not .You ca n't call it writing -- not what I did -- small town material .But I wanted to ask you something .Do you know when I 'm to be moved away to the huts ?In a few days , I guess .make n't be impatient .What 's the matter ?Don't you like us here at the Sanatorium ?Oh -- you -- yes !I do n't care for the atmosphere , though .All those people in bed out there on the porch seem thus sick .It 's depressing .I ca n't do anything for them -- and -- it makes me feel thus helpless .Well , it 's the rules , you know .All the patients have to come here first until Doctor Stanton finds away whether they 're well enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages .And remember you 're a patient just like the ones in bed out there -- even if you are up and about .I know it .But I do n't find as I were -- really sick like them .None of them do , either .Yes , I suppose it's that pipe dream that keeps us all going , eh ?Well , you ought to be thankful .You 're very lucky , if you knew it .Shall I tell you a secret ?I 've seen your chart and _you've_ no cause to worry .Doctor Stanton joked about it .He said you were too uninteresting -- there was thus little the matter with you .
