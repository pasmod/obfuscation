 `` Bread and entertainment '' - or McDonalds and TV-violence ?In the erstwhile Rome the emperor kept the inhabitants of the city happy with bread and violent public entertainment such as gladiator contests .Today we go to the supermarket or McDonalds to buy our food but our television offers us the like kind of entertainment - Violence .Has anything really changed during two thousand years of development ?This is a question that very well might be asked when the TV Guide is studied .Violence is one of the about common elements in TV-programs , movies and above all the TV-news .What is it that makes humans thus fascinated by violence ?Probably it has something to do with power and safety , to sit home in the sofa in front of the TV and see Jean-Claude van Damme beat up another man gives us an adrenaline rush , a thrilling sensation runs down our spine , but it is a safe feeling because we know that the violence is not for actual or at least that it is not happening to ourselves .I think that the fact that the violence is made to someone else is quite important .It is credibly because of this fact that police programs which shows real killings and car chases are so popular .We can sit home and gloat in violence in safety and there is an extra spice added with the fact that this the actual thing .We are at the like time repulsed by this fact and fascinated of it .Are there then anything that freestanding us from our Roman forefathers ?Yes two things , we are more sophisticated in our taste for violence and we are also a lot more comfortable , we do not even have to leave our houses to satisfy our craving for violence .How does this then affect our society ?The question is in fact : Does this affect our company at all ?The number of murders , rapes and thefts in Sweden today are in fact on about the like level as it was a hundred years ago .The alone difference is that the violence has changed its appearance , it is rawer today than it was a hundred years ago .Another factor that has changed is that the public are more aware of the violence today .Many rapes and early kinds of abuse were earlier kept in the silent , today it is instead on the front page of our newspapers .The violence is also closer to us , it has taken the measure over our threshold into our homes .We can learn about it in the morning paper , see it on the evening news and it has become rawer .Today the picture of violence is a lot more distinct than it has been .But it is the like violence that it has always been .The only difference seems to be that it is talked about in a different direction today and brought out in the open to a higher degree .Can there then be any connection between entertainment violence and crimes ?There is no evidence of this .Of course the opposite can not be proved either .It seems to be more a question of social causes like poverty , class troubles and so on then to much TV watching .No , the real danger with TV-violence seems to be the blunting process which the viewers run through .The violence which twenty years ago would give the audience nightmares is today something shown on primetime .In the beginning of the last decade the movie Natural Born Killers were made , the director made it as a statement .It was supposed to be the most violent movie ever made until then and it should make as an eye-opener to the viewers , today it is just a movie among many others .The amount of violence needed to abhor us has been raised to a new level , the humans of today are blunted animals .This is the actual danger of TV-violence .It is because of this we should not allow our children to determine action movies .The question that must be raised is : Do we want to get blunted children or children with feelings ?
