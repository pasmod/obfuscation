IX .Friday morning Armitage , Rice , and Morgan set away by motor for Dunwich , arriving at the village about one in the afternoon .The day was pleasant , but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet apprehension and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep , shadowy ravines of the stricken region .Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt circle of rocks could be glimpsed against the sky .From the air of hushed fear at Osborn’s store they knew something hideous had happened , and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family .Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich ; questioning the natives concerning all that had happened , and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness , the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard , the wounded Seth Bishop cattle , and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places .The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of about cataclysmic significance , and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit .At length the visitors , apprised of a party of State Police which had come from Aylesbury that morning in response to the inaugural telephone reports of the Frye tragedy , decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable .This , however , they found more easily designed than performed ; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction .There had been five of them in a car , but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye thousand .The natives , all of whom had talked with the policemen , looked at first as perplexed as Armitage and his companions .Then old Sam Hutchins thinking of something and turned pale , nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank , deep hollow that yawned close by .“Gawd , ” he gasped , “I telled ’em not ter go daown into the glen , an’ I never thought nobody’d dew it with them tracks an’ that spirit an’ the whippoorwills a-screechin’ daown thar in the dark o’ noonday .... .” A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike , and every ear looked strained in a kind of instinctive , unconscious listening .Armitage , now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work , trembled with the responsibility he found to be his .Night would soon fall , and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch class .Negotium perambulans in tenebris ..... The old librarian rehearsed the rule he had memorised , and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised .He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order .Rice , beside him , took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects ; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he relied despite his colleague’s warnings that no material weapon would be of aid .Armitage , having read the hideous diary , knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect ; but he did not add to the fear of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues .He hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had missed .As the shadows gathered , the natives began to disperse homeward , anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose .They shook their heads at the visitors’ plan to stand precaution at the Frye ruins near the glen ; and as they left , had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again .There were rumblings under the hills that night , and the whippoorwills piped threateningly .Once in a while a wind , brushing up out of Cold Spring Glen , would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air ; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before , when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being .But the looked-for panic did not appear .Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time , and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the darkness .Morning came wanly , and the night-sounds ceased .It was a grey , bleak day , with nowadays and then a drizzle of rain ; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest .The men from Arkham were undecided what to do .Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings , they debated the wisdom of waiting , or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in pursuit of their nameless , monstrous quarry .The downpour waxed in heaviness , and aloof peals of thunder sounded from far horizons .Sheet lightning shimmered , and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand , as if falling into the accursed glen itself .The sky turned very dark , and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short , sharp one followed by clear weather .It was however gruesomely dark when , not much over an hour later , a confused babel of voices sounded down the road .Another moment brought to see a frightened group of more than a dozen men , running , shouting , and even whimpering hysterically .Someone in the lead began sobbing out words , and the Arkham men began violently when those words developed a coherent form .“Oh , my Gawd , my Gawd , ” the part choked out .“It’s a-goin’ agin , an’ this time by day !It’s aout—it’s aout an’ a-movin’ this very minute , an’ entirely the Lord knows when it’ll be on us all ! ” The speaker panted into silence , but another took up his message .“Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the ’phone a-ringin’ , an’ it was Mis’ Corey , George’s wife , that lives daown by the junction .She says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin’ in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt , when he see all the trees a-bendin’ at the maouth o’ the glen—opposite side ter this—an’ smelt the same awful spirit like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las’ Monday mornin’ .An’ she says he says they were a swishin’ , lappin’ saound , more nor what the bendin’ trees an’ bushes could make , an’ all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side , an’ they was a awful stompin’ an’ splashin’ in the mud .But mind ye , Luther he didn’t see nothin’ at all , entirely just the bendin’ trees an’ underbrush .“Then fur ahead where Bishop’s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a nasty creakin’ an’ strainin’ on the bridge , an’ says he could tell the saound o’ wood a-startin’ to crack an’ split .An’ all the whiles he never see a thing , entirely them trees an’ bushes a-bendin’ .An’ when the swishin’ saound became very fur off—on the rud towards Wizard Whateley’s an’ Sentinel Hill—Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he’d heerd it furst an’ look at the graound .It was all mud an’ water , an’ the sky was dark , an’ the rain was wipin’ aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be ; but beginnin’ at the glen maouth , whar the trees had moved , they were still some o’ them awful prints big as bar’ls like he seen Monday.” At this point the first excited speaker interrupted .“But that ain’t the trouble naow—that was only the beginning .Zeb here was callin’ folks up an’ everybody was a-listenin’ in when a cry from Seth Bishop’s cut in .His haousekeeper Sally was carryin’ on fit ter kill—she’d jest seed the trees a-bendin’ beside the rud , an’ says they were a kind o’ mushy saound , like a elephant puffin’ an’ treadin’ , a-headin’ fer the haouse .Then she up an’ spoke suddent of a fearful smell , an’ says her son Cha’ncey was a-screamin’ as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin’ .An’ the dogs were all barkin’ an’ whinin’ awful .“An’ then she get aout a turrible yell , an’ says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over , only the wind wa’n’t strong enough to dew that .Everybody was a-listenin’ , an’ we could hear lots o’ folks on the wire a-gaspin’ .All to onct Sally she yelled agin , an’ says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up , though they wa’n’t no sign o’ what made it .Then everybody on the line could hear Cha’ncey an’ ol’ Seth Bishop a-yellin’ tew , an’ Sally was shriekin’ aout that suthin’ heavy hed hit the haouse—not lightnin’ nor nothin’ , but suthin’ heavy agin the front , that kep’ a-launchin’ itself agin an’ agin , though ye couldn’t see nothin’ aout the front winders .An’ then .... an’ then ... .” Lines of fear deepened on every face ; and Armitage , shaken as he was , had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker .“An’ then .... Sally she yelled aout , ’O aid , the haouse is a-cavin’ in’ .... an’ on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin’ , an’ a hull flock o’ screamin’ .... jest like when Elmer Frye’s place was led , only wuss .... .” The man hesitated , and another of the crowd spoke .“That’s all—not a saound nor squeak over the ’phone arter that .Jest still-like .We that heerd it got aout Fords an’ wagons an’ raounded up as many able-bodied menfolks as we could git , at Corey’s home , an’ come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew .Not but what I think it’s the Lord’s jedgment fer our iniquities , that no mortal kin ever put aside.” Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come , and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics .“We must follow it , boys.” He made his voice as reassuring as potential .“I think there’s a chance of putting it out of business .You men know that those Whateleys were wizards—well , this thing is a matter of wizardry , and must be put down by the same means .I’ve seen Wilbur Whateley’s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read ; and I think I know the right kind of spell to recite to make the matter fade away .Of course , one can’t be certain , but we can always take a chance .It’s invisible—I knew it would be—but there’s a powder in this long-distance sprayer that might make it prove up for a second .by and by on we’ll try it .It’s a frightful thing to have alive , but it isn’t as bad as what Wilbur would have gotten in if he’d lived longer .You’ll never know what the world has escaped .nowadays we’ve only this one thing to fight , and it can’t multiply .It can , though , do a lot of injury ; so we mustn’t hesitate to rid the community of it .“We must follow it—and the means to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked .Let somebody leave the way—I don’t know your roads very well , but I’ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots .How about it ? ” The men shuffled about a moment , and then Earl Sawyer spoke lightly , pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain .“I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop’s quickest by cuttin’ acrost the lower medder here , wadin’ the brook at the low home , an’ climbin’ through Carrier’s mowin’ and the timber-lot beyont .That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth’s—a leetle t’other side.” Armitage , with Rice and Morgan , began to walk in the direction indicated ; and most of the natives followed slowly .The sky was growing lighter , and there were signs that the storm had worn itself aside .When Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction , Joe Osborn warned him and walked ahead to prove the right one .Courage and confidence were mounting ; though the twilight of the about perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut , and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder , put these qualities to a severe test .At distance they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out .They were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place , but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks proved what had passed by .merely a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend .It was the Frye incident all over again , and nothing dead or life was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house and barn .No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness , but all became instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of Sentinel Hill .As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley’s abode they shuddered visibly , and looked again to mix hesitancy with their zeal .It was no joke tracking down something as big as a family that one could not see , but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon .Opposite the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road , and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the wide swath marking the monster’s former route to and from the summit .Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill .Then he handed the instrument to Morgan , whose view was keener .After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply , passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain point on the slope with his finger .Sawyer , as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are , fumbled a while ; but finally focussed the lenses with Armitage’s aid .When he did thus his cry was less restrained than Morgan’s had been .“Gawd almighty , the grass an’ bushes is a-movin’ !It’s a-goin’ up—slow-like—creepin’ up ter the top this minute , heaven only knows what fur ! ” Then the germ of panic seemed to go around among the seekers .It was one thing to chase the nameless entity , but quite another to find it .Spells might be all right—but think they weren’t ?Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the matter , and no reply seemed quite to satisfy .Everyone seemed to find himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden , and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind .
