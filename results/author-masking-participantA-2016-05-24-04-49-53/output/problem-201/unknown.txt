Of course I 'm certain .It was awful big .The biggest fish I ever saw .Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales .Paddy Mike saw it , besides .Sure and I did .And me two eyes nearly fell out of me lead with lookin ' at it , it was that wonderful .He shot a big stream of water right up out of his mind , he did , and then he dived down in the ocean again , and we did n't see him any more at all , at all .There !nowadays if you get to see the great big whale , that 's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come , ain't it ?Whales ca n't bring you no Christmas presents , can they , Klinker ?Und whales you can see any time .I 'd rather have Saint Nicholas , would n't I , Schwillie Willie Winkum ?Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for , Hulda ?Why , make n't you know who he is yet ?He 's the best old man that ever was .Und he comes the night before Christmas und visits all the little children in Holland .Und in Germany , besides .Und if they 're good they get candy und oranges und toys und things , make n't they , Schwillie Willie Winkum ?Und if they 're bad , they get a good big birch stick .But I ai n't been bad .I 've been awfully good , is n't I , Klinker ?Sure .Und me also .On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children march around the streets , following one who carries a big silver star .And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the inadequate .Oh , Christmas time is just grand in Holland !Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas fills 'em with candy .
