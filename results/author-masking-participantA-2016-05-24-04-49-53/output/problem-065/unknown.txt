In the secondary school I hated English lessons .They were constantly the same ; glossary tests , reading a chapter aloud from the book and maybe some grammatics .Not arduous work actually , but I did n't like it anyway .Sometimes we had to discuss openly in the classroom , and it was that part I did n't wish , almost hated .y teacher in the 7 : th till 9 : th grade had made himself a very comfortable way to get off his teaching lightly .Mostly he merely let us see some TV-programs in English .Preferably mister Bean .possibly we did n't learn to much about grammar and so on , but who cared ?We loved the English lessons , of course .It was n't until secondary school I noticed that my English were n't the better .I felt ashamed and made n't wanted to speak or do anything that showed my lack of knowledge .All tests turned away bad , and I who had very good grades in almost all of the other subjects found out that I strongly disliked English .If you 're bad at something and make n't like it ( actually just because you 're bad in it , I suppose ) you wo n't improve , no matter how much your English teacher strains you and herself .She also taught Swedish , where I was one of the better , so she could n't understand why I was such a disaster in English .anyhow , I survived secondary school , consequently avoiding speaking and reading English unless I really had to .Right after school I went to study biology at the university .Suddenly every class book was written in English , and there were no way you could shirk .It was simple : if you did n't understood the English , you would n't understand the class which in turn meant a failed exam .thus I had to deal with my dislike for English .My inaugural book `` Chemistry '' of a thousand pages ought to be finished within ten weeks .At inaugural I had to consult my dictionary for every second word , and it took me a very , very long time .After a while I learned that I did n't wanted to understand every single word .A few books by and by I found out that the English language was n't that bad after all .Now , when I 'm in my third year and have a lot of books behind me the reading is n't any large problem any more .As I mentioned above , I never liked speaking English , I actually hated it in school .But the university indirectly served me out here too .I met a couple of exchange-students .They were even worse in English than I was , but they did n't wish !They just carried on talking and if we Swedes did n't understood what they were saying , which happened frequently in the beginning , they merely tried with body language .We all had a lot of fun , and at the same time I discovered that they did n't care at all about my bad grammar or if I pronounced something in an incorrect manner .They understood what I was saying anyway , and was pleased with it .That , I can tell you , was a relief !The English language now began to interest me .I 've already discovered that I wanted to improve , but now I actually wanted to learn more and make improvements .The literature on the biology courses served me a lot with the understanding of texts , but they did n't taught grammar or pronunciation .I decided to take this English class .Listening is something I have n't prepared since school and I have always thought that I was bad at that too .But after visiting the first lectures I discovered that I actually - without problems - made understood what the lecturers were talking about .The speaking is however my worst skill .I much feel uncomfortable and insecure .But that 's what I 'm here for , to change it !I constantly liked writing - in Swedish of course .It 's so easy in Swedish ; I have a feeling for which sentence that sounds right and which does n't , but in English I do n't get that little voice in my head .I 've always found grammar very boring , and only remembered what I wanted a short while to pass the tests .That 's one of the things that I now regret .however I think it 's a lot of fun to create an essay .
