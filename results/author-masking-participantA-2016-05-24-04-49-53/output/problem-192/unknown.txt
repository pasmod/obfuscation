Mush !Indade and I will ask your pardon a thousand times -- and on my knees , if ye like .I did n't mean a word of what I said or did .But divil a woman in all the ports of the world has iver made a great fool of me that way before !I understand .You mean you 're a lady-killer and they all fall for you .Leave off your fooling !'T is that is after getting my back up at you .'T is no lie I 'm telling you about the women .Though it 's a great jackass I am to be mistaking you , even in anger , for the like of them cows on the waterfront is the alone women I 've met up with since I was growed to a man .I 'm a hard , rough man and I 'm not fit , I 'm thinking , to be kissing the shoe-soles of a fine , dacent girl the like of yourself .'T is entirely the ignorance of your kind made me see you wrong .So you 'll forgive me , for the love of God , and let us be friends from this away .I 'm thinking I 'd rather be friends with you than get my wish for anything else in the world .Sure .God bless you !Ouch !Your pardon , Miss .'T is a clumsy ape I am .It's great power I have in my hand and arm , and I do be forgetting it at times .Gee , you 're some strong , all right .It 's no lie , and why should n't I be , with me shoveling a million tons of coal in the stokeholes of ships since I was a lad entirely .Let you sit down , now , Miss , and I 'll be telling you a bit of myself , and you 'll be telling me a bit of yourself , and in an hour we 'll be as old friends as if we were born in the same house .Sit down nowadays , if you plaze .Well -- But we wo n't talk about me , see ?You tell me about yourself and about the wreck .I 'll tell you , surely .But can I be asking you one question .Miss , has my head in a puzzle ?Well -- I dunno -- what is it ?What is it you do when you 're not taking a trip with the Old Man ?For I 'm thinking a fine girl the like of you ai n't living constantly on this tub .
